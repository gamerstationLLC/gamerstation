The most prominent feature is reduced recoil. The current 2005 version has been developed over 18 years since the patent was sold to Military Police Systems, Inc. The original design was the basis of several later weapons, including the USAS-12 combat shotgun. The shotgun fires in fully automatic mode only. However, the relatively low cyclic rate of fire of around 300 rounds per minute enables the shooter to fire semi-automatically with brief trigger pulls. It is fed from either an 8-shell box magazine, or a 20- or 32-shell drum magazine. In-game Information [ ] The AA12 fires from a 20-round drum magazine, with 60 rounds to spare. The AA12 is very useful for mid and close ranges due to its high fire-rate, similar to that of the SPAS 12 . It has very high damage and low spread to accommodate it, making this weapon an absolute beast no matter what range it is being shot from. For some reason, the AA12 has noticeable bloom, but there is also a quick enough spread recovery that the bloom is pointless. The AA12 is also very useful on mobile, since it requires little aim to kill due to it being a shotgun. Despite how powerful the AA12 is, there still comes drawbacks to counter the pros of this weapon. However, whatever the case, a kill with this weapon is guaranteed even at far ranges. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High magazine size for a shotgun. Tighter pellet spread compared to other semi-auto shotgun counterparts. High headshot damage per pellet. Fast rate of fire. Fast reload for a shotgun. Reloads all of its shots at once. Very fast spread recovery counters bloom. Deals flat damage, no fall-off. Cons: Slow movement speed. Low body damage at long ranges High bloom per shot. Deals flat damage, no ramp-up. Tips [ ] The AA12 is one of the easiest (if not the easiest) Shotgun-class weapons to get a kill with, as it can be spammed without being directly punished. The huge magazine size and quick reload also help with this weapon. You can use this weapon from any range, as every pellet deals a flat damage of 7 (43 if on headshot). The pellet spread changes minimally, so there's no need to adjust your aim the longer you shoot. This weapon is powerful at long-range, and is especially deadly against players using a Sniper Rifle. Its ramped-up damage at close-range is also good for ambushes, firing 2-3 shots will quickly kill your target. The AA12 is especially deadly if used from an elevated platform and shooting down at your opponents. Gallery [ ] Stage one development. Stage two. Stage three. AA12 in real life. Trivia [ ] AA12 was revealed in the Arsenal Discord on September 15th, 2019. The AA12 used to be known as the Atchisson Assault Shotgun and by Maxwell Atchisson . However, this was known today as the \" Auto-Assault 12 Shotgun \" due to having the ability to turn fully automatic. The AA12's stats are quite similar to a combination of SPAS 12 and XM1014 . They are also the only automatic shotguns in the game. Originally, it oddly used the M14 's sounds, however, this was changed after 2 days. Just like most other shotguns used today, AA-12 uses a 12-gauge shell. In reality, it can also use buckshot shells or slug shells. This is not present in the game, however. It is the 3rd shotgun that feds the magazine. The 1st being MAG-7 , the 2nd being Calico , the 4th being TOZ-106 , the 5th being the Nutcracker , the 6th being the RJL Breach , and the 7th being Saiga-12 . Coincidentally, the MAG-7 and the TOZ-106 uses a standard box magazine, the Calico and the Nutcracker uses a helical magazine, the Saiga-12 uses an AK banana magazine, and the AA-12 and the RJL Breach uses a drum magazine. While MAG-7 and the Calico are pump-action shotguns, AA-12, Nutcracker, RJL Breach, and Saiga-12 are automatic, and TOZ-106 is bolt-action. The AA12 fires at 300 RPM which is faster than a majority of shotguns in the game. It is the second weapon that feeds a drum magazine, first being Tommy Gun , third being PPSH . Against all odds, The AA-12 in-game fires close-bolt, even though in real life, it fires open-bolt. The charging handle is also seen reciprocating everytime the weapon is fired, but it doesn't always reciprocate in real life. The old firing sound came from Team Fortress 2's Frontier Justice .

In-game Information [ ] The ABS Rifle is a grey, plastic lever-action rifle. However, unlike most of the other Marksman Rifles, its firing speed is particularly slow, with a 1-second interval between shots. However, its ability to fan fire somewhat negates this. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Decent Accuracy. Fan-Fire ability. Headshots insta-kill. Cons: Poor damage compared to other lever action rifles. Slow firing rate if not fan fired. Slightly slow reload speed. High spread for its class. Has low magazine capacity. Low reserve ammo. Tips [ ] The ABS Rifle's primary fire is very unreliable because of its high spread and slow firing speed. It's recommended to use its fan-fire ability instead by right-clicking. This will fire all of your shots quickly, allowing you to get a kill with this weapon in no time. Make sure that you're at close-range to get a kill with the fan-fire ability. This weapon loads its bullets individually instead of an entire magazine. However, the reloading speed is particularly slow, which won't help you in an intense fight. To get a headshot, only use the first bullet in the clip, as it's the only 100% accurate shot. Reload the ABS Rifle to keep your accuracy. Two single bodyshots while at close-range can be an alternate way to get a kill. Trivia [ ] The ABS Rifle and the Dual Volcanics are the only lever-action weapons that cannot double jump. The ABS Rifle is the only Marksman Rifle that can fan-fire. The ABS Rifle was intended as a weapon for Arsenal: Reloaded . Its design is based on the BrickArms Lever Action Rifle.

Being the \"brother\" of the Flamethrower , the Acid Spitter functions the exact same way, sharing its damage, ammo, limited range, and special afterburn ability. However, there is a unique element to the Acid Spitter, independent from the Flamethrower: its flame particles are bigger and harder to see through. This can practically blind the user's targets but also hamper the user's own vision. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Large magazine size. Very low ammo consumption. Decent rate of fire. Fast afterburn. Fast reload. Flame particles make it hard for opponents to see through. Cons: Extremely low damage. No headshot multiplier. Low mobility. Afterburn will wear off after a few seconds. Unable to be used at longer ranges. Sluggish movement speed. Flame particles make it hard for the user to see through. Tips [ ] Unlike its \"brother\", the Flamethrower , the Acid Spitter's flame effect is less transparent, meaning it's harder to see through. This has its pros and cons. This is good against enemies, especially during ambushes, as they won't be able to tell where to shoot. This is bad for the user who won't be able to see through the flames either, so they will need to mentally pick a target before flaming them in order to guarantee a kill. The Acid Spitter can hit multiple enemies at once, so target groups of enemies rather than individuals if it's possible. The Acid Spitter is best used if you sneak behind an opponent and burn them from behind, rather than confronting them head-on. This weapon loses to almost every other weapon in Arsenal if in a direct confrontation, so ambushing is recommended. If you're being shot at, equip your Knife and run away and find a different route to your opponents. Not doing so will make you an easy target to kill. If you die before you can finish off a player, the afterburn effect of the Acid Spitter will let you be credited as an assist if a teammate kills your burning opponent. Do mind that afterburn will not be as effective if your opponent is still near full HP. It would just be a mild inconvenience to them. You'll be guaranteed a kill through afterburn if your opponent is approximately around the range of 20 HP. Gallery [ ] Stage one development. Stage two. Stage three. Stage four. Trivia [ ] Acid Spitter was revealed in the Arsenal Discord on October 21st, 2020. The weapon was originally going to have a pullback attachment. The Acid Spitter is one of the weapons that have an afterburn effect, along with the Spellbook , the Tavor 's Incendiary shells, the Flamethrower and the Flaming Pumpkin . Much like Flamethrower, Acid Spitter can be broken in any approaches: In the currently inactive gamemode Juggernaut, the Acid Spitter does not do any damage against the juggernaut or as the juggernaut. This has been fixed after. Sometimes, the afterburn doesn't instantly kill the player once the damage hits 100 or more. This also affects the Flamethrower and the Flaming Pumpkin as well. The afterburn damage was used to be broken. This was later fixed on January 5th, 2021. Despite spitting green flames, the afterburn effect's flames are orange-red, like the normal Flamethrower. It is the signature weapon of the Hazmat, Tetra, and Crackles skins.

It was used to give players the Eggmin egg, which gave players a badge too. It was essentially a bootleg Baseball Launcher that fired insta-kill eggs that gave players badges instead of baseballs. The firing animation of the weapon is flinging the egg out. The Admin Launcher was discontinued after the 2019 Egg Hunt event. It can still be spawned in by using a custom gamemode in private servers and can still be fired, however the projectile does not appear. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast fire rate.

Its design was inspired by an earlier German assault rifle known as the StG-44. The AK-47 fires intermediate and powerful 7.62x39mm rounds, and is (arguably) the most known gun. In-game Information [ ] Current Archived The AK-47 is an automatic rifle that holds 30 in the magazine within the ammo reserve of 60. It carries quite the punch for people who know how to tap fire at long ranges, and spray at close. Although the headshot damage is lower than more popular culture suggests, it still is viable due to the extremely low time to kill in Arsenal . The only major setback is the high recoil, which is somewhat jarring when first shooting the weapon. In the archived version, the AK-47 reflects the rifle's real capabilities; the AK-47 will deal 23 damage at very long ranges and will do 62 damage upon a headshot at most ranges. It fires from a 30 round mag, with 60 rounds in reserve, and comes with a two-second reload time. The only downside to it is its high spread, hindering its ability to be utilized at long ranges. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast reload time. High damage at close ranges. Moderate magazine size. Good fire rate. Cons: High spread penalty. Moderately low minimum damage. Hefty recoil Tips [ ] The AK-47 deals respectable damage, but also has high spread and recoil. Because of this, only the first 10 bullets are accurate enough to kill opponents from mid-range. As with every weapon with high spread, more bullets will land if shooting from close-range. The spread is quite unpredictable. It's practically only more accurate than Machine Guns. The high spread will also make it difficult to land headshots, so beware. The AK-47 takes 2.8 seconds to reload. This is fast, but when in intense fights, you can easily be killed before you finish reloading. Gallery [ ] Current AK-47 stage one development. Stage two. Stage three. Stage four. Stage five.

Trivia [ ] The current model of the AK-47 was revealed in the Arsenal Discord during the Sci-Fi Update development on September 10th, 2020. A model of the AK-47 from Unit: Classified ( ROLVe other project) made an appearance in the Summer Update II trailer. The inspect animation is taken from Counter Blox , ROLVe's other game. The reload sound is also taken from Counter Blox. The AK-47 uses the same base animations as the G36 , albeit slightly edited when pulling the bolt. Strangely, the AK-47's archived model was an AKM taken from Left 4 Dead . The AK-47 is one of the main weapons used in the \"story mode\" games Operation: Infiltration and Operation: Exfiltration .

It uses a smaller 5.45×39mm cartridge, replacing the 7.62×39mm chambering of earlier Kalashnikov-pattern weapons. The rifle first saw service with Soviet forces in the 1979 Afghanistan conflict. The head of the Afghan bureau of the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence claimed that the CIA paid $5,000 for the first AK-74 captured by the Mujahideen during the Soviet–Afghan War. Today, the rifle is used by most countries of the former Soviet Union. Licensed copies were produced in Bulgaria (AK-74, AKS-74 and AKS-74U), and the former East Germany (MPi-AK-74N, MPi-AKS-74N, MPi-AKS-74NK). In-game information [ ] In-game, the AK74 reflects rifle's real capabilities: The AK-74 will deal 21 damage at very long ranges, and will do 70 damage upon a headshot at most ranges. The AK-74 can be best be seen as a balance between its older counterpart, the AKM , and Western Bloc rifles such as the M4A1 . It fires from a 30 round mag, with 60 rounds in reserve, and comes with a two-second reload time. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage at close quarters. Fast rate of fire. Fast reload time. Moderate magazine size. Cons: High spread penalty. Moderately high recoil. Low minimum body damage. Trivia [ ] The AK74's uniquely-orange magazine can be attributed to the 5.45x39mm round's special design, requiring special plastics for magazine construction The AK74's full name is the \" Автомат Калашникова образца 1974 года \", which when translated means \" Kalashnikov automatic rifle model 1974 \". The AK74M, a modernized variant of the AK-74, is currently in use by the Russian Federation's armed forces alongside the AK-12. The AK74 in-game features a folding wire stock, indicating its an AKS-74 variant. Strangely, the AK-74's model is mirrored to the left side. This trait is shared with the AKM . In the Mega Update, the AK-74 used Insurgency's AK-74 firing sound. The AK74's firing sound was changed to the 2013 CS:GO AK-47 firing sound. Gallery [ ] AK74 in real life.

It is a common modernized variant of the AK-47 rifle developed in the 1940s. Introduced into service with the Soviet Army in 1959, the AKM is the prevalent variant of the entire AK series of firearms and it has found widespread use with most member states of the former Warsaw Pact and its African and Asian allies as well as being widely exported and produced in many other countries. The production of these rifles was carried out at both the Tula Arms Plant and Izhmash. It was officially replaced in Soviet frontline service by the AK-74 in the late 1970s, but remains in use worldwide. The AKM maintains the AK-47's wood stock, but has simpler individual parts that are favorable for mass production. Like the AK-47, many variants of the AKM exist such as the AKMS, AKML, and AKMP. In-game Information [ ] The AKM is a powerful weapon up close, with its hefty recoil and high close range body damage. At longer ranges, the weapon suffers owing to its low minimum body damage and its powerful recoil. Headshots with this weapon will always take 2 shots to kill at any range, making headshots a viable way to kill targets at range. The AKM is fed by a 30-round mag, with 60 rounds in reserve. Its reload time lasts two seconds. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Fairly fast fire rate. Fast reload time. Moderate magazine size. Cons: Moderately low long range body damage. High spread penalty. High recoil. Trivia [ ] The AKM is the most commonly found variant of the AK family of firearms and was introduced into Soviet service in 1959. It fires a 7.62x39mm cartridge. A common tactic with the AKM was to have massed numbers of troops advance rapidly, firing the AKM as they went. While this often resulted in highly inaccurate shot scores, this Soviet-style Blitzkrieg tactic of putting thousands of rounds at a target was deemed effective. Besides the 10 million AKMs manufactured in the Soviet Union alone, millions more were produced under license by Eastern Bloc nations such as Romania, Bulgaria, and Poland. Pirated copies were also produced worldwide, numbering in the tens of millions. The AKM, like the AK-74 in-game, have their charging handles and fire selectors on the left side. Their fire selectors are set to semi-auto, however, they fire in fully-automatic mode. It is the signature weapon of Anna, Phoenix and Casual Bot. Despite the AKM being Phoenix's signature weapon, the Old Habits Badge still requires scoring a kill with the AWP as the respective skin. The AKM's firing and reloading sound used to have the sound of the AK-74, however, this was changed in the Summer Update , to distinguish it from said weapon. The weapon model is mirrored, as the real life model of the AKM has the charging handle on the right side, instead on the left.

It uses 50-round P90 magazines mounted horizontally on top, with brass ejecting through the top of the weapon. It was designed by AR57 LLC . In-Game Information [ ] The AR-PDW (previously called the AR57 ) is an automatic rifle that is seen in Arsenal: Reloaded and Arsenal . This weapon is fairly efficient, having a fast fire rate, high damage, low spread, and low recoil. This weapon can be used both at long, and short ranges. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Great magazine capacity. Low spread for its class. Can kill enemies quickly due to the fire rate and damage. Cons: Moderately slow reload. Tips [ ] The AR-PDW's firing speed and immense damage make it one of the more deadly Automatics in the game. Take advantage of this. It's practically a more accurate version of the P90 . The AR-PDW also shoots very accurately, allowing you to effectively fight from mid- or even long-range. Be careful when fighting from long-range as the distance will make your damage have fall-off. Its accuracy allows it to defeat opponents currently using Shotguns. In gamemodes without the \"promotion on kill\" mechanic, such as Randomizer or Gun Rotation, the AD-PDW is very good at fighting off squads of foes. Its gigantic magazine capacity allows you to take on many at once, but only at the cost of a slightly slow reload.

It is a pirate-designated cannon attached to an arm that fires rusty cannonballs. The Arm Cannon is a unique weapon because of its damage, counting the direct impact and splash damage. Its ability to rocket jump guarantee the player with a whole-map look and whole-map snipe if possible. This cannon can be reloaded shell-by-shell which means the player can reload after each shot and if the player misses their shot, the ball have a high splash range which means the player can severely damage the target and kill them with another shot or assist another player(s) to kill the target. The player can also kill several players camping at a point with the canon, guaranteed by the instant-kill direct hit damage and also the prominent splash damage, but the weapon also have some disadvantages, such as the player can kill themselves when using this weapon when engaging in close-quarter combats because of the high splash, the projector is slow and the empty reload speed is hazardous, which can guarantee the enemy a kill when the player can't reload, melee-fight, med-pickup or hide in-time. The slow rate of fire also made up for the disadvantages, making each shot count. The best strategy when using this gun is to snipe or shoot from a long distance, and try to not engage in any close-quarter combat situations. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Ability to rocket jump . 1-by-1 reloading allows topping off. One-shot kill on direct hits and splash damage. Huge blast radius. Holding the left mouse button activates two cannonballs at a time. Cons: Long empty reload time. Users can easily kill themselves if not careful. Slow rate of fire. Slow projectile speed. Small delay between shooting and the projectile being released. High self-damage.

Contents 1 General Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Weapon History General Information [ ] The Armament is a Jovian, scoped laser rifle released in the Galactic Assault Update of Arsenal . It is commonly used by interplanetary travelers due to is extreme accuracy at long ranges. This weapon has a slower fire-rate compared to some of the weapons of its sort, however, this weapon has a higher magazine capacity compared to most of the other automatic rifles. This weapon also has a scope that performs like the scopes used on most snipers. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High ammo count. High headshot damage. Contains a scope for longer ranges. Low spread for its class. Scope reduces spread. Cons: Slower fire rate for its class. Low damage. Tracer shots allow opponents to track your position. Tips [ ] The main downside of the Armament is its low damage of 20-25. This makes it a losing battle against more powerful weapons. To make up for this, the Armament is effective from long-range, where you can be just outside of some weapons' range (such as Pistols and Shotguns). Use the Armament's scope at mid- to long-range to make your shots more accurate. At close-range, however, do not use the scope so you don't hamper your vision while aiming at opponents. Headshots are the most effective way to get kills with the Armament, so aim for the head as much as possible. It deals a hefty 75 damage, which essentially can be enough for a teammate to get you an assist. Gallery [ ] TBA Trivia [ ] It was revealed in a trailer that a Cephalokin Elite canonically created the Armament.

It was adopted by the Austrian Army as the StG 77 ( Sturmgewehr 77 ) in 1978, where it replaced the 7.62×51mm NATO StG 58 automatic rifle (a licence-built FN FAL). In production since 1978, it is the standard small arm of the Austrian Bundesheer and various national police units. Its variants have also been adopted by the armed forces of dozens of countries. Steyr AUG importation into the U.S. began in the 1980s as the AUG/SA (SA denoting semiautomatic). President George H.W. Bush banned the AUG via an executive order under the 1989 Assault Weapon Import ban. Six years into the ban, AUG buyers gained a reprieve as cosmetic changes to the carbine's design allowed importation once again. Changes included the pistol grip being changed into a thumbhole stock, and the barrel left unthreaded to prevent attachment of flash suppressors and silencers. The ban sunsetted in 2004, and in 2008 Steyr Arms worked with Sabre Defense to produce parts legally in the U.S. In-Game Information [ ] The AUG is a top-of-the-line assault rifle, sporting decent damage at closer ranges, accuracy, and recoil. This weapon has low spread, which is easily used at long range. It carries 30-round magazine, which is not an issue despite this weapon has slightly fast fire-rate. However, it comes with some drawbacks; namely the slightly longer-than-average reload time in its class, and the low minimum damage. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Decent close-range damage. Has low spread. Moderate magazine size. Fairly fast rate of fire. Scope makes shots more accurate. Cons: Low minimum body damage. Longer reload time compared to other assault rifles. Hip-firing is less accurate at long-range. Tips [ ] The AUG is a very powerful weapon from any range, thanks to its re-addition of an intergral scope. At longer distances, use the AUG's scope to see enemies clearly and shoot more accurately. At close-range, do not use the scope and fire normally. Scoping in will limit your vision and your aim. The AUG is more of a one-and-done weapon due to its mighty killpower, but very slow reload. To be most effective with this weapon, be sure to get a kill within the first clip, or you'll be a sitting duck for opponents while you're reloading. Trivia [ ] The AUG in real life features a unique \"progressive trigger\". It allows the user to switch between firing modes by simply putting the right amount of pressure on the trigger. For example: To fire at semi-automatic speed, the trigger needs to be pressed gently. To fire at fully automatic speed, the trigger needs to be pressed forcefully. The AUG is one of the 4 bullpup weapons in the game along with the L86A3 , the Dual Shotguns , and the FAMAS . The AUG is taken from Counter Blox . In Gun Game , the AUG is the only automatic rifle with a scope. The AUG is also the only weapon to be removed in Gun Game until it was brought back in the Mega Update. The AUG along with the Rocket Launcher , the Peacemaker , the Barrett , the Trench Gun , the G-17 , the XR15 , and the DB Shotgun are the only primary weapons that appear in the Arcade gamemode. The AUG fires a 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge in real-life. The current model is the AUG A1 , as evident by its integral scope, while the previous and the pre-alpha model is the AUG A3 , with its picatinny rail and a shorter barrel. The pre-alpha model also featured an ACOG Sight . The AUG did not have a scope at all prior to 10 Year Anniversary Update , which made it less effective from further distances.

It has a similar distance decay ability like the Crossbow and has mild recoil. It has a moderate rate of fire, and the bolts travel very slowly. Body hits from this weapon can possibly one-shot, but it always one-shot kill on the head. Unlike the Crossbow, it is equipped with a scope. Users may have trouble reloading as the animation will obstruct the crosshair. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Using scope has greater magnification. One-shots at close-range. One-shots on headshot. Fast rate of fire. High damage. Fairly fast reload. Large magazine size. Cons: Reload animation obstructs most of the view. Projectile arch and speed can make it difficult to kill at long ranges. Tips [ ] The Autobow is a versatile weapon, being able to kill from any distance. However, it performs best if at close-range, where its ramped-up damage is strong enough to insta-kill. It also kills upon headshot, so firing from a safe distance in an attempt to get one is a good strategy. If firing from long-range, use the scope to see your targets better. Do beware that aiming directly at them won't make your projectiles land, as they will drop to the ground before they reach . Try aiming a little bit higher than their head so the projectile arc is high enough to land a hit. The Autobow has an incredible damage range. Worst case scenario, a single shot from far away that deals 75 damage will be enough for a teammate to get you an assist. Trivia [ ] The ammo ticker refills before the reload animation finishes. This weapon is featured in the Holiday Havoc trailer. The Autobow is the first projectile weapon to have a scope. The Autobow is the final weapon to use In the Snipers Only gamemode , where getting a kill wins the round.

Main Archived The AWP is a very powerful weapon, as evidenced by its 115 body shot damage at all ranges and 322 damage headshot. Like the M40 and MS556 , the AWP is uses a bolt-action firing mechanism, meaning that the player will have to cock the bolt after every shot. This causes the AWP to have an agonizingly slow firerate, especially when compared to other powerful 1-shot sniper rifles like the Barrett and Railgun . The sluggish firing speed paired with its slow pullout time makes it extremely important to hit each shot. Like the other snipers, the AWP comes with a scope that can be accessed using the RMB or the V key. On mobile devices, the sniper scope can be accessed by pressing the scope button. In the Archived version of Arsenal , the AWP (simply known as Tactical Sniper in Gun Game ) is quite similar to how it is today. The only difference was the abhorrent magazine size, with 5 rounds in each mag. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Perfect accuracy. One-shot kill for both bodyshots and headshots. Accessible scope allows for better magnification. Large magazine. Firerate can be increased by double keying Cons: Sluggish reload and barrel covering the crosshair. High recoil. Extremely sluggish movement speed. Slow fire-rate. Slow pullout time. Scope tracer may giveaway user position Tips [ ] The AWP is best used from a very far distance, where you can easily shoot at opponents but they cannot easily shoot back at you. Because the AWP makes the user slower, equip your Knife if travelling across the map to avoid being easily killed. Do beware that the AWP takes a while to fully pull out, so equip it if you find a good spot to snipe from or if you suspect an opponent is around the corner. As with every Sniper Rifle, do not scope in if your opponent is at mid- or close-range, as the limited vision will make you an easy kill. Trivia [ ] The AWP is part of Accuracy International's series of Arctic Warfare bolt-action rifles, including notable weapons such as the Arctic Warfare Magnum ( AWM ), Arctic Warfare Suppressed ( AWS ), and the AWP itself. It's normally chambered for 7.62x51mm/.308 Winchester (AWP and AWS) or .338 Magnum (AWM) cartridges, but is able to be made for others. The AWP is most notable for its inclusion in the Counter-Strike series as a powerful bolt-action rifle with a distinctive muzzle report, and with it being the signature weapon of Phoenix in Arsenal and the Old Habits Badge requiring a kill with this weapon as the respective skin, this further connects the reference. However, in the Halloween Update , the Phoenix skin now has an AKM , but the badge wasn't affected. The in-game model is most likely an AWM. The AWP makes the same sound as the AWP from 2012 in CS:GO except it is slightly quieter. Despite being extremely powerful, the AWP stands for Arctic Warfare Police and is chambered in a lighter law enforcement caliber being 308. Winchester. Even with that, the AWP still possesses a massive 1-shot kill capability. Gallery [ ] AWP in real life.

It was eventually succeeded by the M60 in 1957. In-game Information [ ] The BAR is a very powerful automatic rifle, packing quite some punch with each bullet. The damage is a guaranteed minimum four shot kill to the body and a minimum of two shots to the head, though at close range players will see two shots to the body, and one shot to the head killing their targets. It has a surprisingly low spread, meaning the BAR has use up to longer range engagements. However, the BAR's main drawback is its fire rate; players may lose out at closer ranges to faster firing weapons. There is a silver lining though- with the BAR's low magazine size and low fire rate combined, players will likely never need to reload the BAR mid fight. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Low spread. High damage. Overall slow ammo consumption rate due to its fire rate. Quick reload. Cons: Sluggish rate of fire. Small magazine size for its class. Slow movement speed. Gallery [ ] Remastered model of BAR created by Nredly. BAR in real life Trivia [ ] When it was first released, the player carrying the BAR in third person appears to be held incorrectly. The BAR is considered both an automatic rifle and an LMG, although it was rarely used as the latter due to the low ammo per magazine. The BAR was also designed to be carried by an infantryman during an assault advance while supported by the sling over the shoulder or to be fired from the hip. The BAR had an FN-designed pistol grip and the rate-reducer mechanism with two rates of automatic fire that was shelved in favor of a rate-reducer mechanism designed by Springfield Armory .

Despite its designation as an anti-materiel rifle, it is used by some armed forces as an anti-personnel system. The M107 variant is also called the Light Fifty for its .50 BMG (12.7×99mm NATO) chambering and significantly lighter weight compared to previous applications and the 15% heavier base M82 model. The weapon is found in three variants, the original M82A1 (and A3), the bullpup M82A2 and Barrett M107A1 with muzzle brake designed to accept a suppressor and made out of titanium instead of steel. The M82A2 is no longer manufactured, though the XM500 can be seen as its successor. In-game Information [ ] Current Archived In Arsenal , it is the fifth strongest weapon in the game, only being outmatched in damage by the Musket , Pulse Musket , Tavor , and the Literal Gun . It deals 200 damage; twice the maximum health capacity. Since you can fire multiple shots without reloading, it's easy to get kills with this weapon. However, its lengthy reload and slow walking speed makes it harder to hit when pushed up close. Its semi-automatic nature does make it surprisingly effective at killing opponents in close-quarters combat. However, it has lots of recoil, so spamming the weapon isn't recommended at longer ranges. As of the Christmas 2020 Update, the Barett now knocks the user back slightly while in the air. While it is possible to perform a recoil jump similar to the DB Shotgun or DBS to a lesser extent, it would require the user to expend quite a bit of ammo to achieve such a feat. The Barrett M82A1 (simply known as Heavy Sniper in Gun Game ) was different in the Arsenal Archived than it is now. It had a crosshair, a trait shared by snipers in the Archived version. However, it had the widest crosshair in the game, making it hard to land a body shot, let alone a headshot. The fire rate was also much slower compared to how it is now. It also un-scopes after a shot when your scoping. However, It still killed enemies with one-shot. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros Guaranteed one-shot kill on body hit or headshot. Has no spread. Scope allows for better magnification. Large magazine size for a sniper rifle. Able to recoil jump . Cons Extremely sluggish movement speed. Somewhat slow fire rate Extremely slow 5.5 second reload time. Massive recoil. Slow pullout time. Air knockback is noticeably weaker than the DB Shotgun and DBS . Scope tracer may giveaway user position Tips [ ] The best strategy with the Barrett is to use at least 3-5 shots to recoil jump, then use the rest to snipe opponents that are down below. Don't recoil jump too high! You can easily be spotted in the sky and shot down. The Barrett only lets you recoil jump upward , not forward. Do not use this weapon to get around the map. If you get a kill while up in the sky, you can attempt to shoot at other opponents while falling to quickly promote to the next weapon. If you use up all your shots, the best thing to do is resort to melee combat with your Knife instead of waiting out the entire 5 seconds of the reload. This situation is a win-win, as you can either get a kill or be killed by an opponent and instantly regain all 10 shots upon respawn. You can still hide behind a wall or object to reload, but you will more likely to be found and killed while doing so. Trivia [ ] Barrett was renamed to HCS-50 during Arsenal: Reloaded Beta Testing . The HCS-50 was also used in another ROBLOX game, Enforcement . Barrett was one of the few archived weapons that still persisted their Gun Game design. The Barrett deals the fifth highest damage in the game, only surpassed by the Tavor , the Musket , the Pulse Musket and the Literal Gun . The Barrett has the highest DPS of any weapon in the game, with 400-500 DPS to anything but the head, and a whopping 1120-1400 DPS to the head. The gunfire sound is used from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 . The Barrett is meant to be used as an anti-material rifle, but can be used for anti-personnel roles if needed. The Barrett is tied with the SPAS 12 for the 4th longest reload time with 5.5 seconds, surpassed by the MG42 with a 5.75-second reload, the Musket with a 6-second reload, and the Dual Volcanics with an 18-second reload time (only if both magazines are emptied). Carrying the Barrett is extremely heavy; it weighs 29.7 lb (13.5 kg). It's heavier than all the machine guns in the game. The in-game model is an M107 , the modified version fit for U.S Military weapon designations. This is the signature weapon for the Jackeryz and Beezul skins. The Barrett is the first of the three semi-automatic sniper rifles in-game. The Barrett in-game is fitted with a bipod. The Barrett along with the G-17 , the XR15 , Peacemaker , the AUG , the Trench Gun , the DB Shotgun and the Rocket Launcher are the Arcade gamemode weapons.

At closer ranges, the Baseball Launcher deals 45 damage, and deals max damage at longer ranges (67 damage). It fires baseballs at a somewhat capped rate, being semi-automatic. It feeds from a 10-round cylinder and has twenty baseballs in reserve, along with a somewhat long reload time. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Arching shot allows for the projectile to hit enemies behind walls. Decent fire rate. Decent magazine size. Decent reload time. Cons: Projectile Arch makes it harder to hit enemies across further ranges. Fires a projectile, meaning that timing is key. No headshot multiplier. Gallery [ ] Baseball Launcher in real life. Trivia [ ] Before the 2.1 Update , the model for the Baseball launcher was different and seemingly did less damage. The model was taken from a ROBLOX gear called Snowball Cannon . This is the signature weapon of the Commando, Santa, Baseball Star and Ski Star skins. The model is based on the TKB-0249 Russian launcher. This is one of the few weapons to have a ramp-up. The firing sound for this weapon is similar to the firing sound of the real life \"Thumper\" grenade launcher, also known as the M79 .

Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Trivia 5 Audio 6 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The BH10 performs similarly to the P90 . It has a fast firing speed and fair accuracy, only having low damage. Tap-shooting this weapon will reduce the spread at longer ranges and kill enemies quickly. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast rate of fire. High magazine size. High damage at close quarters. Cons: Low minimum damage. Relatively high spread. Moderately slow reload. Moderate recoil. Tracer shots can give away position at far ranges. Tips [ ] The BH10 is the most effective at close- or mid-range, where its quick firing speed can easily overwhelm opponents that aren't paying attention. At long-range, only the first 7 shots from the BH10 will be accurate enough to land on your target. However, firing a few at a time, then waiting before firing again will allow you to land more shots. The BH10 also has a slow reload of 2.5 seconds. Make sure to get the kill if in an intense fight, because running out of ammo will make you an easy kill to your opponent. The BH10 shoots tracer shots, which will make it easy for opponents to figure out your current location. To avoid this, only take out targets that are near you instead of far away. That way, your victim's teammates won't be able to find you. If possible, try to target opponents that are indoors instead of out in the open to limit the visibility of your tracer shots. Trivia [ ] The BH10 is a reference to the 2001 shooter game, \" Halo: Combat Evolved \", and the entire franchise itself. It shares the appearance of the SMG and the MA5D Assault Rifle. This, along with the Pathbringer , the Z80 , and the Pulse Musket do not use the Evaporate kill effect by default.

Blunderbuss is considered, an early predecessor to the shotgun, due to functioning similarly. This weapon saw a wide-service in medieval and Napoleonic armies, along with Muskets . The Blunderbuss provides a high damage in the closer range, plus fast reload, making this an independent weapon when there is only the user and the enemy. However, the user is only allowed 1 shot, and afterwards throws the Blunderbluss in the direction they are currently facing, which can deal extra damage if it hits an opponent. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Quick reload time. High damage at close range. Able to be thrown after every fired shot. No damage fall-off . Cons: Only one round per magazine. Moderate recoil. Low reserve ammo. When thrown, projectile arch makes it a bit hard to hit enemies at longer ranges. Last shot doesn't throw the weapon. Tips [ ] The Blunderbuss excels at ambushes rather than taking opponents head-on, as you only have limited ammo to use. Keep an eye out for ammo boxes dropped by any dead players to avoid losing ammo completely. There's a secret to the Blunderbuss: you don't have to wait for the entire reload animation. As soon as your character throws a Blunderbuss away, that is when you can fire again (not when your character pulls out another one). If your shot lands but doesn't kill, aim a bit more upward so you can deal an extra 30 damage to your target, potentially finishing them off. The best strategy with the Blunderbuss is to get close to the enemy and try to land a shot, then immediately retreat to reload. Try to patrol the map and pay attention to the corners, as players can hide in them and wait for an enemy to come nearby. Trivia [ ] This weapon used to drop on to the ground upon death. The Blunderbuss still drops when thrown. This originally could cause servers to break because the dropped blunderbusses didn't de-spawn, although this was fixed. Despite the Blunderbuss being able to be reloaded, the player just throws the weapon away after every shot. Occasionally, when hitting or killing a player, it will make a LG phone echo ringtone.

Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Trivia 5 Audio 6 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The Bomb is an intriguing weapon in its unique fuse time mechanic, the Bomb's base fuse time is 3.2 seconds and explodes on impact. Players can hold the right mouse button to charge the bomb to make the fuse run its course faster. It is recommended that players don't fuse the bomb for too long, as the overcooking the Bomb can result in death. The Bomb can instantly kill anyone unfortunate enough to be caught in its explosions, coupled with its large splash radius, It should be noted that any player that can utilize the bomb's strengths is to be feared. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Explodes on impact. Instantly kill an enemy upon blast. Ability to cook the bomb by holding RMB. Explosive area-of-effect capability allows for collateral kills. Rebound ability. Has the fastest rocket jump in the game. Infinite ammunition. No reloading required. Cons: Users can easily kill themselves if not careful. Sluggish 2.5-second cooldown. High self damage upon rocket jump. Rocket jumps send users forward instead of upward. Tips [ ] The Bomb is a very dangerous weapon, as it insta-kills both opponents and the user. Make sure to throw your Bombs far away from you as possible to avoid blowing yourself up. Tapping the fire-button will immediately throw your Bomb, exploding within 1 second. Throwing Bombs with a 1 second timer will often explode in mid-air, so you this attack works best at close-range to make sure the Bomb gets a kill. (Remember not to get too close as the explosion can kill you too) Holding down the right-click button will give your Bomb a 4 second timer. Letting go of the button will throw the Bomb. Use this attack to throw Bombs at opponents who are at a good distance away from you. This means not at close-range. Beware that you cannot throw another Bomb until the first has exploded, so make sure to use this attack wisely. When using the 4-second attack for the Bomb, work on your timing. When you should let go of the right-click button depends on how far your target is from you. Immediately throwing is best for killing players at long-range. It can even hit an opponent on the other side of smaller maps. Throwing when there's 2-3 seconds left is best for opponents at mid-range. The Bomb has the fastest rocket jump in the game. Tapping the fire-button while aiming below you will initiate a rocket jump. However , you will travel forward instead of upward. You can use this to get to the other side of bigger maps very quickly. Beware that rocket jumping will deal a hefty amount of damage, so you can only rocket jump once before you blow yourself up. Trivia [ ] The Bomb was added to Standard as an actual weapon in the September Update before being removed due to possible backlash. The Entertainer and Performer skins (and their Jester counterparts) have this as their signature weapon. The Bomb was broken in the Projectiles Party gamemode. But later this was now has fixed.

It features a charge mechanic that ups its damage the more it is charged. Just like the Crossbow, it travels in an arc and has a ramp-up feature. This makes it effective to use in long-range. When using this weapon, players should take full advantage of the \"pull-back\" feature. The bolt/arrow travels further and does more damage this way, one-shooting the enemy on a full charge. Players should use it like how they would use the crossbow: long-range sniping. Due to the fact that it is charge shot, it's not recommended to take the Bow into close quarters, as players can easily be killed while charging. However, the Bow should not be pulled back for too long. Once the Bow hits full-charge, the velocity of the fired arrow will slowly decrease as the arrow is over-charged. When the arrow fully charges up, it must be aimed to release it as fast as possible, otherwise, it will not go very far. However, if one does have to get into close quarters, tap shooting is a viable option, with a 2-shot kill. However, the Bow's range goes down severely, so not charging up the weapon should only be used in emergency close-range situations. The right mouse button can be used while charging the arrow to cancel the drawing. This is only used to save ammo or to switch weapons without firing. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: All arrows will insta-kill, charged or not. Charge mechanic allows for more damage the longer the fire is held. Decently fast charge time. Projectile will travel further on a higher charge level. Fall-off helps deal more damage. Cons: Slow fire rate. Charging for too long will decrease the arrow's velocity and effectiveness. Bow shots cannot be pre-charged without efficiency being lost due to arrow overcharge. Tips [ ] The Bow requires you to be calm (and have a little bit of luck) in order to get a kill. Unlike the other weapons, jumping around and flicking your aim won't help. Staying in one place and shooting is your only viable strategy. Without charging up, the Bow hits opponents at close-range. However when charged, it hits at long-range. This allows for quick reactions if confronted up close, and calm, calculated shots if sniping far away. As mentioned before, all arrows will insta-kill, no matter the charge or if it lands on head or body. Use the charge for distance rather than damage. Work on your ability to predict. Try guessing where an opponent is running to and send an arrow in that direction. This is easier against opponents running in a straight line, or is approaching you directly. Unless you have no other option, don't try to hit any opponents that are constantly running and jumping around. The Bow is useless against opponents that are on a higher platform than you. Aim for opponents that are on your height level. You can attempt to hit the opponent with an uncharged shot, as the arrow's heavy arch angle will be more likely to land it. Do note that this may be tricky as you'll mostly be shooting from a blindspot if directly below the opponent. On the other hand, the Bow is effective if you're above, and your opponents are below. For a bigger chance of success, use the Bow against groups of opponents that are close together instead of trying to hit a single target. If all else fails, remember that you can resort to melee combat with your Knife . This especially comes in handy during the Gun Rotation gamemode if everyone has the Bow. If you move unpredictably, you can dodge and weave between flying arrows and attempt to backstab opponents. If you're coming to Arsenal as a Typical Colors 2 player, the Bow is nearly the exact same as the Huntsman that the Marksman uses. However, the Bow deals way more damage, with all of its arrows being able to insta-kill without aiming for the head. Nevertheless, use the Bow exactly as you would the Huntsman. Gallery [ ] Development of the Bow. Trivia [ ] The Bow was listed as Compound Bow in the DevForum post of July Update . The Bow has the fastest reload in the game. The Bow is the signature weapon of the Spidra and Waike Delinquent skins . The Bow is used to utilize the same sounds and mechanics as Team Fortress 2's Huntsman. The Bow in-game is more specifically known as a Compound Bow, using a system of cables and pulleys to bend the weapon's limbs. The Bow along with the Pocket Potassium , the Golden Gun , the Musket , the M79 , the M16A2 's grenade launcher, and the RPG are the only weapons in the game that carries a single only one round. The Bow can be fired after a match ends if it is fully charged. However, it cannot deal damage.

In-game Information [ ] This weapon was very similar to that of the MS556 but was lower in body shot damage. Because it was added in quickly, ROLVe possibly didn't get a chance to balance it. It was super easy to obliterate enemy's because of its ammo pool and its higher damage. Also, it was a perfect weapon for the gun-knife combo. Gallery [ ] A Solid Color C14 Timberwolf. C14 in real life. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast fire rate. Crosshair was available. One-shot kill to the head. Sniper scope helps players pick off from longer ranges. Cons: Low body damage. Trivia [ ] C14 Timberwolf is one of an few archived weapons that still persisted their Gun Game design. The in-game model is the Remington 700 . The C14 didn't have an inspect animation and had a choppy reload animation, this was possibly due to this weapon being added so late in the game. The C14 was the only Canadian made weapon in the game.

In-game Informaton [ ] The Calico fires a typical 9-pellet spread, with each dealing from 6 to 13 damage. As it is a shotgun, it is best used in closer ranges with targets. The Calico also has an extremely large 25-round helical magazine, and players will seldom need to reload when using it. However; should a player need to reload, the Calico's magazine fed nature lets them reload it quickly. It is also pump-action, so players will have to wait a brief period of time to re-pump the weapon after firing a shot. The Calico has an extremely wide pellet spread compared to other shotguns, making it so that you need to be very close to your intended target. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Largest magazine size in-class. Fastest reload time in-class. Very high damage or instant kill when close range. Firerate can be increased by double keying Cons: Slow rate of fire. Very wide pellet spread. Low damage per pellet. Tips [ ] The Calico is one of the more difficult Shotgun-class weapons to get a kill with, as it is only effective at very close range. Do not attempt to shoot from mid-range, as you will have to depend on luck rather than your aim to even land a hit. If shooting down at enemies from a higher platform, crouching will slightly ramp-up your damage. To make up for its range, the Calico's 25 shots per magazine and fast reload will help you win intense fights at close range. Gallery [ ] Calico in real life. Trivia [ ] The Calico Shotgun was a prototype 12-gauge pump-action shotgun showcased in 2012, during the SHOT Show . However, since then the manufacturer has not given any word about it; as such, it is assumed to have been canceled. Calico Light Weapons System , or simply Calico, is well known for their top-mounted, helical-feed magazines on all of their firearms. An example would be their Calico 9mm pistols, capable of holding 50 or 100-round magazines, or the Calico SMG, such as the Calico M960. The Calico was modeled by MAD STUDIO developer, nettimato, who also did the STEN , G11 , TOZ-106 , the Dual Shotguns , the Focus , the Stake Launcher and the Peppermint Rifle . The Calico has a delay before firing when switched or getting it, however, this was patched in the September Update . The Calico is the second shotgun that feeds from a magazine with the first being the MAG-7 and the third being the AA12 .

The weapon design resembles the Empty Shell LLC.'s XM556 Microgun with a pair of 6-rotary barrels. In-game Information [ ] The gun runs off a single ammo pool of 400 rounds, making it being a second highest ammo pool in the game after Minigun , the gun also fires 2 barrels at once without pause. The only drawback of this weapon is high spread, but it is not a problem if you are fighting in close to medium combat, and the consecutive firing of 4 bullets combined with the fast firerate means you are almost guaranteed to hit a target except in extreamly long range maps such as boulevard, lumberhouse, or diner. Because of its killing capabilities, it is one of the best weapons in the game. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast rate of fire. High ammo pool. 4 bullets per shot. Fixed spread pattern. No reloading required. No rev-up time. Cons: High spread penalty. Low minimum damage. Tips [ ] The Candy Cane Miniguns are a ridiculously powerful weapon, as it shoots very quickly, and each individual shot uses four bullets . To balance its firing speed and bullet usage, this weapon only deals 10-40 damage and its spread is very high. The Candy Cane Miniguns will absolutely dominate close-range fights. However, due to its spread, it's less viable at long-range. Luckily, this weapon has a fixed spread pattern, preventing users from having to predict which bullets will land. If firing from long-range, aiming for the upper-half of your target's body will make it more likely to deal headshot damage. Aiming for the head itself is less viable. If using the Candy Cane Miniguns in a gamemode without the promotion-on-kill mechanic (such as Randomizer or Gun Rotation), keep an eye out for ammo boxes to constantly refill your ammo, as this weapon does not have ammo reserve. Gallery [ ] Sketch. Drawn silhouette. Weapon render. Trivia [ ] Candy Cane Miniguns was revealed in the Arsenal Discord on December 18, 2020. This, along with its normal counterpart, the Minigun, are the only weapons in the game that shoot multiple bullets and are not considered shotguns. This is most likely inspired from the ROBLOX limited item known as the Candy Cane Launcher .

It is an electric guitar that shoots team-colored sound waves, each one dealing a splash damage of 80. This weapon also features a unique blast-jump. Instead of shooting at the ground while jumping, the user simply needs to point towards the air and right-click , which will send them in the direction they are aiming. Although, this comes at the cost of 14 HP. Contents 1 Pros &amp; Cons 2 Tips 3 Trivia 4 Audio 5 Weapon History Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Fast fire-rate. Unlimited ammo capacity. Splash damage allows for area-of-effect kills. Blast-jump speed is fast. Cons: Moderately slow projectile speed. User can damage or kill themselves if not careful. Blast-jumping is fast enough to send users off the map. Tips [ ] The Chord Tosser is one of the most powerful weapons in Arsenal . Not only can it deal splash damage at a fast pace, it also has the ability to blast-jump. The best strategy for the Chord Tosser is to blast-jump, then start firing on opponents down below. This way, it will be easy for you to get a kill and hard for your targets to fight back. Remember that your projectiles have splash damage, so you can potentially get multiple kills if you target groups of enemies. To get insanely fast travel speed while mid-air, you have to do two blast-jumps , one after the other. The first one should be aimed upwards, which will throw you off the ground. The second should be pointed forwards (at a slight upward angle to stay in the air longer). This specific blast-jumping method will get you high in the air and circling around the map quickly. This will allow you to fire in all directions. This method also helps you to memorize the current locations of your opponents, so when you promote off the Chord Tosser you know where to go for your next kill. The Chord Tosser is also good to use defensively, as you can escape opponents quickly with a blast-jump. Trivia [ ] The Chord Tosser's model is based on the Fender Telecaster electric guitar.

It is the sole weapon in the gamemode, Concussion Mania . The Concussion Rifle is a mix of a normal bolt-action rifle and a rocket launcher . It shoots explosives that operate similar to that of a rocket launcher, as each shot sends an explosive round. However, as the explosive-tipped rounds have the same velocity as any other bullet in the game, dodging the explosive blasts generated by the rounds is nearly impossible. If players utilize the decent blast radius of the Concussion Rifle's rounds, they can score multiple kills if a group of enemies are close together. It is also capable of rocket jumping , and is one of the most efficient weapons for doing so. Upon a player jumping and firing at their feet, they will only be dealt 1 damage and will fly upwards. This can also be used against enemies, albeit with 50 damage dealt instead of 1, sending them flying. If the player fails to rocket jump they will be dealt 2 damage. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Can send enemies flying off the map. High reserve ammunition. High damage. Very low self-damage when rocket jumping. Cons: Small 6-round magazine in general. Moderately slow reload. Does not have extra damage on impact hit. Users can damage themselves upon splash range. Tips [ ] The Concussion Rifle is one of the deadliest weapons in the entire game, as it immediately makes an explosion on wherever the user is aiming. In other words, this is a hitscan weapon, but instead of traditional bullets, it makes explosions. The traditional (and still effective) strategy with the Concussion Rifle is to use 1-2 of your shots to blast-jump, then while mid-air, shoot down at opponents still on the floor. You can blast-jump higher by rubbing against a wall while mid-air and then firing against that wall. In the Concussion Mania gamemode , the player that's the highest in the air has the biggest advantage as they can see everyone down below. The Concussion Rifle's extreme knockback have upsides and downsides. Because this weapon deals tiny self-damage, you can blast-jump to your heart's content. The knockback it does on opponents , on the other hand, will make it hard for you to track them when they're launched away. Opponents hit by the Concussion Rifle will have a hard time fighting back, as they get knocked back and it's more difficult to hit someone that's mid-air. Remember that it takes three explosions to kill an opponent. This is half of the Concussion Rifle's magazine. In Concussion Mania, reloading leaves you very vulnerable to opponents. Make sure to avoid reloading as much as possible by making your shots count. Trivia [ ] The weapon model the Concussion Rifle is using is the De Lisle carbine, a .45 ACP British firearm that is considered one of the quietest firearms ever made. It was mainly used during World War II in very limited quantities by specialist units. The De Lisle carbine in real life does not fire explosive shots. This weapon is tied with the Lightning Cannon for the lowest self damage while rocket jumping . This gun is one of the few guns that can be used for recovery from falling off the map (rocket jumping off the walls in Dizzy , scaling the boat and launching off the water in Aircraft ). Originally, this weapon did a flat 50 damage per explosion, killing opponents in only two shots. Originally, if a player had a frame unlocker, they would be able to zoom with the weapon, but this was patched in the August Update . Originally, this would do 20 self-damage while strafing. This weapon's old firing sound was taken from Classic 's old firing sound from Typical Colors 2 , which was taken from a Team Fortress 2 weapon with the same name.

Crossbows shoot arrow-like projectiles called \" bolts \" or \" quarrels\" . A person who shoots crossbow is called a crossbowman or an \" arbalist \"(after the arbalest, a European crossbow variant used during the 12th century). In-game Information [ ] In-game, the Crossbow 's slow fire rate and projectile arch make it a really hard weapon to use, but when a player is hit, it is a rewarding experience. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Instant kill upon hit. No reloading required. High ammo pool. Cons: Slow fire rate. Projectile Arch can make it difficult to hit targets. Trivia [ ] Before a patch was made, ramp-up seemed to be non-existent, so the crossbow only did 50 damage on the body with 150 on a headshot. However, this bug went unnoticed for a few months as nobody but the developers knew that it was supposed to have distance decay. The Crossbow's model and animations were used for a Doctor primary, the Crusader's Crossbow in Typical Colors 2 .

First introduced in 1975, it is one of the original \"wonder nines\" featuring a staggered-column magazine, all-steel construction, and a hammer-forged barrel. It has a good reputation amongst pistol shooters for quality and versatility at a reasonable price. In-game Information [ ] The play-style to this weapon is very similar to that of the G-18 at the time as it was another rapid-fire pistol. The spread is not a problem with this weapon nor the damage as it has decent damage for a pistol at that position in the game. The users expect that the weapon has low ammo capacity and high recoil, which makes long ranges shots harder to hit the opponents. The ideal strategy is to either walk around trying to find an enemy up close, or bait an enemy close to you. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Able to hold fire. Very high damage at close quarters combat.

Despite its poor public reputation, the weapon is functional outside of conditions where its faulty magazine design would cause jams and malfunctions. Notably, the weapon as it is represented in Arsenal is a fusion of two Chauchats. In-game Information [ ] In-game, the DB Chauchat is a double-barreled LMG. When using the weapon's AA sights, the DB Chauchat will deliver a 2-round burst, which will instantly kill a target upon a headshot if 2 shots connect. At longer ranges, it will take 5 shots to the body to kill an enemy. Even with the special burst fire, the Chauchat has a low rate of fire and moderately high spread, so the possibility of landing a burst may be at a low percentage. Although it has a notably quicker reload than other machine guns, it still has a very slow reload. Firing in automatic mode will give the weapon high spread and somewhat moderate recoil, along with a very low rate of fire. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High headshot damage. ADS allows for greater aim and a 2-burst mode. Fast reload for a machine gun. Low ammo consumption rate. Cons: Slow rate of fire. Low first-shot accuracy. High spread penalty unless using ADS. Long burst delay when using ADS. Slow movement speed. Moderate recoil. Lowest 40-round magazine capacity in-class. Long pullout time. Tips [ ] The DB Chauchat functions more like a Marksman Rifle than a Machine Gun. Instead of spraying bullets by holding down the firing button, you only shoot two at a time. Hence, this weapon won't exactly make any one-sided fights in your favor. The DB Chauchat's accuracy is questionable , as it generally does not shoot accurately. However, if you aim-down-sight (by right-clicking), its accuracy becomes viable. This means that it's best to not use this weapon at close-range to avoid moving your aim too much to hit your shots. Being at mid-range also makes it easier to hit headshots. The DB Chauchat's reload is incredibly slow, so it is especially important to get a kill before you empty a magazine. Holding out this weapon will make you slower. You can revert to your original speed by equipping your Knife . Gallery [ ] ADS DB Chauchat in real life. Trivia [ ] The main reason for the weapon's poor reputation is its many flaws. The Chauchat's open-faced magazine allowed debris to enter the weapon and cause clogging. Its poor component quality lowered reliability drastically. Parts of differing qualities were often mixed together. Overuse of the weapon to the point of overheating caused a lack of function. The Chauchat utilizes a muzzle booster/gas assist and a long recoil system (often seen in shotguns, and the only use of it in an automatic weapon). The poor design of the Chauchat is not entirely the fault of the weapon or its designers; the French had to reinvent the wheel in order to get around existing patents on gas-operated machine gun mechanisms. France's resulting creation was overcomplex and unreliable but got the job done. The Chauchat was one of the first light, automatic rifle-caliber weapons designed to be carried and fired by a single operator and an assistant, without a heavy tripod or a team of gunners. The DB Chauchat is one of the weapons that has the ability to ADS. The others are MK18 , the M14 EBR , the Falkor , the Vector , the Pulse Musket , and the DBS . The DB Chauchat is the fourth weapon with burst fire capability added to Arsenal . The DB Chauchat is also the second 2-round burst weapon added into Arsenal , the other is the XR15 . Due to a glitch, players cannot use the burst fire ability on mobile.

Each shell fired from the shotgun via left-clicking will shoot out 9 pellets, dealing 12 damage per pellet at close ranges and 3 damage at long ranges. Right-clicking with the DB Shotgun in hand fires both barrels at once, doubling the number of pellets shot and knockback received while in the air. The DB Shotgun also grants players the ability to shotgun jump, as known as the recoil jump ability, providing a useful utility both into and out of combat. To shotgun jump, players will need to jump and fire at their feet by either left-clicking or right-clicking. This will launch them into the air, but controlling in mid-air can be rather difficult. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Has recoil jump ability. Extremely fast fire rate. Instant burst firing mode, allowing for higher damage. Fast reload. Cons: Low magazine tube size. Frequent reloads due to low tube size. Low minimum pellet damage. Massive recoil. Tips [ ] The best strategy for the DB Shotgun is to use first shot for a recoil jump, and use the second shot to kill an opponent. This weapon is not very effective at mid-range. Find ways to get closer to opponents. Doing a recoil jump and then pouncing on an oblivious opponent may be the way to go. The DB Shotgun may have a fast reload, but beware that it's not fast enough to reload in an intense fight against an opponent. If you're coming to Arsenal as a Typical Colors 2 player, the DB Shotgun is a bit different than the Lupara DB. Both weapons still need to be used at close-range in order to deal serious damage. However, while the Lupara DB can still somewhat deal good damage at mid-range, the DB Shotgun cannot. The DB Shotgun has a unique ability to fire both barrels at once by right-clicking, dealing more damage and making it more likely to get kills. Trivia [ ] According to the model's creator, Revenant, the DB Shotgun's model is based on the Super Shotgun from DOOM Eternal , created by Mark Van Haitsma , and the Double Barrel Shotgun from Pavlov VR , created by Emmanuel Marshal . &#91; 1 &#93; The weapon was wielded with one hand prior to its current model. The previous model can still be seen as a worldmodel. The old DB Shotgun was taken from Typical Colors 2 , where it is used by the Flanker class and is known as the Lupara DB . Strangely, the animations of the shotgun were specifically changed for use in Arsenal. They are still the same in Typical Colors 2 . It is based on Team Fortress 2's \" Force-A-Nature \". Both can also use their recoil to perform a double/triple jump. This reference is still prevalent, despite the change of model. It is one of 3 weapons that is capable of recoil jumping, the others being the DBS and the Barrett . The DB Shotgun, along with the Rocket Launcher , the Trench Gun , Peacemaker , Barrett , G-17 , the AUG , and the XR15 are the only primary weapons that appear in the Arcade gamemode. It is currently the shotgun with the fastest fire rate even without RMB, as RMB fires both shells simultaneously. This is the signature weapon of the Beach Bum, Campbell, Rough Houser, and Slayer skins. The badge \"Evil no More\" is obtainable by getting a double barrel shotgun kill with the Campbell character. The badge name, choice of character, and choice of the Double Barrel shotgun as the weapon is a reference to the Evil Dead horror series. The shotgun's old reload sound was taken from Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl . Gallery [ ] Reload. Weapon Render.

It is an elephant barreled weapon that fires a large caliber bullet, which is the reason why it has a very long barrel. It instantly kills no matter how close or far players are from their target and does 114 on a headshot at any range. As it is a double-barreled rifle, the DBS can only load two rounds at a time. It is also equipped with a simple optical sight, which can be looked down upon by right-clicking. The fire rate is extremely fast, and players can expect an easy kill as long as they keep the aim true. Recoil jumping is possible with the DBS. It is able to launch players very far up into the air with every pull of the trigger. It can be performed by aiming down at the character's feet, jumping, and firing at the ground. Players will take no damage from this, so it's recommended to do this as often as possible to gain a height advantage. Despite looking like a shotgun, the DBS is essentially a two-barrel cannon, and thus the gun has no spread, requiring an accurate shot to kill. When reloading, the bullets being ejected and put into the barrels, if seen carefully, are actually rifle rounds. this proves that it is not a shotgun. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros Instant kill on any part of the body. Capable of recoil jumping . Fast rate of fire. Equipped with an optical sight. Quick reload speed. No spread. Cons Small 2-round ammo capacity. Optical sight has less zoom for its class. Hefty recoil upon firing. Frequent reloads due to low magazine tube size. Tips [ ] The DBS is both useful and dangerous to the user. It one-shots opponents, but its recoil can sometimes mess up your aim and movement. The DBS isn't as effective at long-range like the other Sniper Rifles, but it is able to successfully hit an opponent at mid-range. Its scope isn't as zoomed in as the other Sniper Rifles, so it can only let you see so far. A viable strategy for the DBS is to use one or both shots to find a higher place, then carefully shoot down at opponents below. You can also do the DB Shotgun's strategy to use the first shot to recoil-jump, then immediately use the second to get a kill. Do mind that this will make it a lot easier for opponents to kill you if you're not fast enough. Try not to jump and shoot at opponents, as the recoil can stop you from moving forward. Gallery [ ] ADS Reloading DBS in real life. Trivia [ ] While at first glance the DBS appears to just be a scaled-up version of the DB Shotgun, the DBS is actually a side-by-side elephant gun. It is a very large caliber firearm designed for big-game hunters. On reloading, the shells loaded into the breech are clearly and noticeably massive. In reality, such a gun would be uncontrollable when fired, as the recoil would tear the shoulder support off. Also, the muzzle energy from such a weapon would usually result in the user being concussed and deafened. The DBS's sounds are the same as the DB Shotgun , albeit slowed down and lowered in pitch. The DBS is based on the CZ Hammer Classic shotgun because of the exposed hammers and the shape of the stock. Killing the player with the DBS while in mid-air at 20 studs will get the \"Elephants can't fly\" badge. The DBS is one of the guns with ADS, the others are the MK18 , the M14 EBR , the Falkor , the Vector , the Pulse Musket , and the DB Chauchat . It is also the first sniper rifle to have an access to ADS while the Pulse Musket being the second. The DBS model was originally used for Marksman's primary weapon, the Poacher's Pride in Typical Colors 2 . This is one of 3 weapons that you can recoil jump with the others being the DB Shotgun and the Barrett . It is the signature weapon of Jockey, Arctic Excavator, Mamor, and Farmer skins. The sight on the DBS appears to be a Nydar Model 47, an early optical sight which first appeared in 1945. If aiming-down-sights with the DBS with the \"Enemy Outlines\" setting on, the outlines will not appear in the scope.

It has also found fame through its portrayal in different FPS games including Valve's Counter Strike series and Activision's Call Of Duty series. Former American arms manufacturer, Magnum Research Inc. (MRI), designed and developed the Desert Eagle in the late 1970s. The design would later be refined by Israel Military Industries (IMI), which would also be responsible for manufacturing it until 1995, when the contract shifted by MRI to Saco Defense in Saco, Maine. In 1998, MRI regranted the manufacturing rights back to IMI. In 2005, IMI sold its small arms branch to the private holding company SK Group, where they would rename it to Israel Weapon Industries. Since 2009, the Desert Eagle Pistol has been produced in the United States at MRI's Pillager, Minnesota facility. Kahr Arms acquired Magnum Research in 2010. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio (Outdated) 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] A pistol chambered for various magnum cartridges, the Deagle is a powerful pistol with both intense body and headshot damage. It is able kill an opponent with two shots at anywhere on the body, and deliver an instant kill on the head. However, the Deagle's damage comes with drawbacks. It has the small 7-round magazine. Spamming with the Deagle easily expends ammo, even though the fire-rate is slow for its class and the reload time is fast. The Deagle also has a high recoil, which can obstruct the users' aim. If faced in the situation where range is involved, try not to spam fire and aim for the head. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Has low spread. Fast reload. One shot-kill on the head. Cons: High recoil. Small magazine size. Slow rate of fire. Tips [ ] As with any first-person shooter the Deagle has appeared in, this weapon's most infamous trait is the high recoil. Spamming your shots will make it impossible to land any hits, so you'll need to space out your shots as much as possible. Use the Deagle at close-range so you can quickly two-shot nearby opponents. If at mid-range, take careful aim so you can land a headshot. At longer ranges, crouch so your aim is easier to control and get a headshot. Gallery [ ] In third person. A Solid Color Deagle. Deagle in real life. Previous Deagle in real life. Trivia [ ] The version in-game seems to fire a .50 AE cartridge, based on the 7-round magazine capacity. Although the barrel looks thinner than it's supposed to be. The current and archived version appears to be based on the Mark VII . The previous version in-game appears to be the Mark XIX , owing to the Picatinny rail placed on the top of the barrel. Sometime in May 2019, the Creagle variant of the Deagle was secretly added into Arsenal by Castlers, but was eventually removed one day later. It is the signature weapon of the Festive Partygoer, Fro, Fro Vice, Holiday Panda, Partygoer, Red Pand,a and Soccer Star skins . Before the Summer Update , the Deagle used the same firing sound effect present of the Deagle from the Counter-Strike series. This was eventually changed to the sound the Deagle used in another popular ROLVe game, Counter Blox . The archived version was called the \" Desert Eagle \". The model was also used for the archived version of the Golden Gun. The Pre-Alpha/Alpha version was taken from Counter Blox: Roblox Offensive another ROLVe project. Deagles are typically colored silver, but black versions exist as well. Popular movies such as The Matrix and Austin Powers feature the Deagle.

The Dispenser is a plastic stick that holds small candies inside with a Delinquent head on top that can be pressed down on; the Dispenser always throw out candies, while the users pressed on the Delinquent head. The Dispenser holds 18 candies in a clip with 72 ammo in reserve, even though they are not bullets. Its damage is quite low, doing 20 per candy, meaning that it can kill an enemy with 5 shots. However, it is an automatic projectile weapon so it can instantly kill an enemy. Due to its fire rate, it can also quickly expend its magazine capacity of 18. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Decent clip size. Fast auto fire rate. High ammo reserve. Cons: Low damage. Has projectile arch, making it harder to hit enemies. Magazine will easily be expended due to its fire rate. Gallery [ ] Stage one development. Stage two. Stage three. Stage four. Trivia [ ] Dispenser was revealed in the Arsenal Discord on October 3rd, 2020.

As most Soviet troops were equipped with submachine guns and assault rifles, the Dragunov could provide long-range firepower to support the troops far in front of its barrel. In-game Information [ ] The Dragunov can be seen as a counterpart to the Western Bloc rifles, such as the M1 Garand . Players can expect a minimum three-shot kill on the body, a guaranteed one-shot kill on the head, and a high magazine capacity similar to rifles such as the M1A1 Carbine . What makes the Dragunov stand out from the others though is its fast reload time and its fast rate of fire. Because of its similarity to other semi-auto rifles, the Dragunov suffers from the same problem: the high spread penalty. Players will have to tap fire to make every shot count, although aiming for the head or going closer makes up for it. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast rate of fire. High damage. High magazine capacity. Fast reload time. Cons: Slow movement speed. High spread upon continuous shots. Tips [ ] The Dragunov is one of the Marksman Rifles with the fastest (if not the fastest) firing speeds the game. It shoots only slightly slower than any Pistol-class weapon. Its damage range 45-56 damage, which will even let you quickly beat an opponent holding a Pistol-class weapon. However, the Dragunov is also the slowest movement-speed Marksman Rifle, so traversing through the map may be difficult. Remember that you can revert to your original speed by equipping with your Knife instead. The Dragunov is best at close-range to ensure that its high spread of bullets will be more likely to hit opponents. You can try to fire a shot from a long-distance, but you will have to take careful aim. A headshot from any range will reward you with a guaranteed kill. Trivia [ ] The Dragunov also appears in the beta version of the game. But the beta version is called the SVD and is equipped with a PSO-1 scope to it. When it was released, the Dragunov has the appearance of the M14 in third person. The Dragunov's spread is no more the same as the FN FAL . Originally the killicon for this weapon was a placeholder, using a similar killicon to map hazards and suicides. The killicon was later changed to the M14. The Dragunov model came from ROLVe's other game, Typical Colors 2 as the Classic . The damage and some sounds in Dragunov are similar to the SKS Rifle. Gallery [ ] Dragunov in real life.

In-Game Information [ ] The Dual Berettas had a great fire-rate and a low damage. The spread was moderate, compared to the PRISMAS . They carried 30-round magazine capacity with 60 ammo in reserve. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast rate of fire. Decent reload speed. High magazine size. Cons: Moderate high spread. Low minimum damage. Trivia [ ] The Dual Berettas are inspired from the weapon with the same name in CS:GO . This weapon at the time did less damage than its single version, the M9. This was the first dual-wielded weapon in Arsenal . The Dual Berettas made a re-appearance in MURDER inside the reception room in Miami .

Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] Added in the Summer Update III , the pairs shoot at least a bullet per fire, dealing a 36 damage on the body and 50 damage on the head at long range. In close range, this weapon can 2-shot kill on the body, while a single shot in the head. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Tight spread. High damage in close range. Faster fire-rate. Cons: Somewhat lengthy reload. Magazine is quickly emptied due to its fast fire-rate. Tips [ ] The Dual LCRs accuracy, damage, and firing speed make it a deadly weapon at intense fights, especially against other Pistols. However, the crushing downside is its reload, which takes approximately 3.5 seconds. This leaves you wide open for a free kill during intense fights. When confronting an opponent at close-range, quickly empty out your shots to get the kill without getting damaged. At longer ranges, however, it's best to space out your shots. Remember that the Dual LCRs' reload is particularly slow, so you need to avoid reloading as much as possible. Gallery [ ] Stage one development. Stage two. Stage three. Stage four. Stage five.

Trivia [ ] The Dual LCRs along with the PRISMAS , the Dual Shotguns , the Dual Volcanics , and the Micro Uzis are the only dual-wielded weapons in current Arsenal .

They were introduced in the Summer Update II . In-game Information [ ] The Dual Shotguns are similar to the DB Shotgun , having a high pellet count, a fast rate of fire, and low damage. Despite its main con of doing low damage, the rate of fire and pellet count make up for it, doing above average damage at close and medium range. However, for the sake of balance, the low damage per pellet will still be a problem as seen by shooting. It also has a gruesome reload, among the slowest in the game, and can be a major problem if spraying doesn't kill the enemy. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast rate of fire. High pellet count. Decent ammo capacity. 2-by 2-reloading allows topping off. High maximum damage per pellet Cons: Low minimum damage per pellet. Long reload time. Tips [ ] The Dual Shotguns are one of the easiest (if not the easiest) Shotgun-class weapons to get a kill with, due to their bigger and fixed pellet spread. The pellet spread makes this weapon viable from any distance, from close-range to nearly long-range. However, this does not mean you can snipe someone from across the map, so don't waste time trying to do so. Do not get too cocky when using the Dual Shotguns, as its overpowered shots are balanced out by its slow reload. Avoid losing all of your shots if possible. Gallery [ ] The Dual Shotguns in real life. Trivia [ ] The Dual Shotguns are the 4th dual-wielded weapons to be added to Arsenal , the others being the Dual Volcanics , the PRISMAS , Micro Uzis and the Dual LCRs . It is also the first dual-wielded shotgun to be added to Arsenal . Unlike other dual-wielded guns in the game, the dual shotguns use a different model in each hand. This is due to the bullpup design, as firing the right-handed model from your left hand (or vice versa) would cause spent casings to be ejected at the shooter. This is the fifth weapon that was made by MAD STUDIO developer, nettimato, others being the Calico , the G11 , the STEN , the TOZ-106 , the Focus , and the Stake Launcher . The Dual Shotguns is one of the 4 bullpup weapons in the game along with the AUG , the L86A3 , and the FAMAS . The Dual Shotguns has the most pellets out of all the shotguns in the game after the DB Shotgun .

It is a pistol version of Volcanic's famous lever action rifles. The first design was in 1854, where partners Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson, worked on the Smith &amp; Wesson lever pistol. After this, they formed a firearms company named Smith &amp; Wesson, which was then changed to Volcanic Repeating Arms, until Oliver Winchester (one of their biggest investors) forced the company out of business, and took the assets to make New Haven Arms Company in April 1857, which was responsible for the making of the Henry Rifle . Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio (Outdated) 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The Dual Volcanics deal a damage range of 35-105; 35 is being dealt upon a long-range body shot, while 105 is being dealt at closer ranges, instantly killing an opponent. They also require two headshots to kill at longer ranges, due to the weapon dealing 87 damage upon an accurate long-range headshot. It is worth mentioning the Volcanics come with a spread penalty upon successive shots and a slow rate of fire, meaning that players will have difficulty hitting targets beyond medium ranges. The Volcanics come with a large 16-round ammo pool, with 8 cartridges in each pistol. While this capacity comes as an advantage in prolonged fights, upon the expenditure of all ammunition, players will have to suffer through a lengthy reload process. This is due to rounds having to be loaded individually, 2 rounds loaded into the pistols every couple of seconds. Every shot must count as the Dual Volcanics are infamous for having the longest reload, standing at eighteen seconds or three times the reload of the Musket if the magazine tube is empty. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High ammo capacity. High damage. 1-by-1 reloading allows topping off. Large magazine size for its class. Cons: Relatively slow rate of fire. High spread upon continuous shots. Grueling 18-second empty reload time. Tips [ ] The Dual Volcanics are a very technical weapon. It deals respectable damage, but its reload is very, very slow. Unlike most of the other Pistols, the Dual Volcanics reloads its ammo one bullet at a time. And since it takes 2 seconds to reload 2 bullets and there are 16 per magazine, well... Due to its slow reload, the Dual Volcanics identifies as a \"one-and-done\" weapon, which will push users to get a kill without reloading if possible. The Dual Volcanics will only get you a kill at close-range. At this distance they deal hefty damage, but if you get very close it will one-shot kill opponents. At mid-range, you'll only deal at least 35 damage. This won't guarantee any kills, but you can attempt to get an assist if a teammate helps you kill your target. Its slow firing speed makes you weaker at intense fights. Try to sneak and get a close-range kill to avoid getting shot at. Gallery [ ] In third person. The Volcanic Pistol in real life. Trivia [ ] The Volcanics in-game can be found in real life as the Volcanic Repeating Pistol , firing either a .31 or .41 caliber \"Rocket-ball\" cartridge. It was manufactured by Smith &amp; Wesson , known at the time as \" Volcanic Repeating Arms Company \". The Rocket-ball cartridge the Volcanics use is often seen as underpowered, with muzzle energy being 56 pounds per foot compared to the 9mm being 383 pounds per foot of energy. This weapon's spread increases each time when fired, which makes no sense as the pistols alternate shots. One pistol firing should not affect the other pistol's spread. The Volcanics along with the PRISMAS , the Dual Shotguns , Dual LCRs and Micro Uzis are the only dual-wielded weapons in current Arsenal . This is the signature weapon of the Alchemist Plague Doctor, Beckoned Pirate, Halloween Vampire, Pirate, Plague Doctor &amp; Vampire skins. The Dual Volcanics has the longest empty magazine reload time in the entire game, with a whopping 18-second reload, triple the time it takes to reload the Musket which takes 6 seconds. The Dual Volcanics almost makes the same exact sound as the PRISMAS but is more lower-pitched and the sound passes slowly with a very audible sound. The Dual Volcanics are the only lever-action weapon in the game that do not allow their wielder to double jump. The Dual Volcanics used to not have its firing sound effect.

Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Trivia 5 Audio 6 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] Added in the Anniversary Update of Arsenal . It is a powerful fictional automatic revolver made up with electric bullets that can kill an enemy in three hits at long ranges and one at close range. Firing with the Electric Revolver lacks spread and does not headshot. Shots came with splash damage allowing players to kill multiple people with it; the particles are seen distinctively. It is also automatic, so players who hold their mouse down will experience a fast rate of fire. It also has a low ammo capacity, meaning that going full auto will expend its ammo in a few seconds. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Fast rate of fire. Has area-of-effect damage. Has no spread. One shot at close range. Cons: Fast ammo consumption rate. Splash damage can damage or kill the user. Small magazine capacity. Slower reload compared to other revolvers. No headshot multiplier. Tips [ ] The Electric Revolver is essentially a weaker version of the EM249 , keeping the same AOE damage and fast fire-rate, but with a very small magazine size. Remember that you do not need to aim directly, but rather at an opponent's feet to deal damage with this weapon. This weapon can be used at any range, as it's good for sniping from a distance or one-shotting up close. This weapon may shoot automatically, but it's best to only shoot one or two at a time to avoid its slow reload. Trivia [ ] The Electric Revolver to be either based on the earlier models of the S&amp;W M10 or the Colt New Service revolver. When it was released, the Electric Revolver had the appearance of a Windicator in third person. The killicon formerly used an icon of a Windicator. The Electric Revolver is one of the automatic pistols along with the G-18 , the TEC-9 , the Little Tom , and the Falkor . It is also the first automatic revolver to be added into Arsenal . The speed loader is still visible on the player's arm if they turn their FOV to 110 or above on settings. Electric Revolver is the sole weapon in Slaughter gamemode. It supposed to represent as a taser for the event. It also essentially has only one ammo in its magazine for the gamemode, with more ammo being available by finding and picking them up.

Contents 1 General Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History General Information [ ] The EM249 is an electric variant of the M249 and was added during the Anniversary Update . Some changes to it include the stock completely cut off, electric ammo, made of different materials, and more. The EM249's high magazine capacity allows users to not suffer from frequent reloads. Its fast rate of fire and no spread means that the players will be shredded in a few seconds. However the EM249's low minimum damage, sluggish movement speed, reload time, and the absence of a headshot multiplier means killing enemies might be slower. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Very high ammo capacity of 100. Fast rate of fire. Splash damage allows for area-of-effect kills. Has no spread. High damage at close ranges. Cons: Users can damage or kill themselves if they are close to the splash damage. Sluggish movement speed. Grueling reload time. No headshot multiplier. Low minimum damage. Tips [ ] This weapon does not have headshot damage. Instead, aim for an enemy's feet to let the splash-damage effect of each bullet hit. This weapon is good to use from any distance, however it excels the most at long-range. Because there's no spread, you can easily deal more damage than any opponent that is firing back at you. If you fight an enemy at close range and the EM249's bullets accidentally damage you, pick up your enemy's dropped health kit before moving on. This will guarantee your survival, especially in the Randomizer gamemode. This weapon has 100 bullets in one clip, but in turn the reloading speed is very, very slow. If you end up reloading this weapon, it is recommended that you find a safe place to hide first, as you'll be vulnerable in more open areas. Gallery [ ] Development of the weapon. Trivia [ ] EM249 was revealed in the Arsenal Discord on November 17, 2019. Its counterpart, the M249 , was removed from Arsenal after the re-haul update. The M249 was later readded in Summer Update III . This gun was made in the morning of the day of the Anniversary Update. It's the reason why there used to be a placeholder kill icon and no reload sounds. When it was first added to the game, the EM249 has the appearance of the M60 in third person. The killicon used to have an icon of the M60, now the EM249 had received an official killicon. The bullets on the reloading animation are currently broken. Its model and animations were used for the M249 in Typical Colors 2 , but recolored, without electric bullets, and with a stock. After the EM249 had no spread in the Community-Ops Update , the crosshair would still expand just like when it had spread. However, in the Summer Update II , the crosshair no longer expands. Unlike its bullet counterpart, the EM249 has no stock. The EM249 makes an appearance in the RPG Event as the weapon used by the Cover Unit enemy.

It is a re-skin of the Bomb that can be used exclusively in Hard / Insane Mode. Contents 1 Pros &amp; Cons 2 Tips 3 Trivia 4 Audio 5 Weapon History Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Explodes on impact. Instantly kill an enemy upon blast. Ability to cook the bomb by holding RMB. Explosive area-of-effect capability allows for collateral kills. Ability to rocket jump. Infinite ammunition. No reloading required. Cons: Users can easily kill themselves if not careful. Sluggish 2.5-second cooldown. High self-damage upon rocket jump. Tips [ ] The Explosive Barrel is a very dangerous weapon, as it insta-kills both opponents and the user. Make sure to throw your Barrels far away from you as possible to avoid blowing yourself up. Tapping the fire-button will immediately throw your Explosive Barrel, exploding within 1 second. Throwing Barrels with a 1 second timer will often explode in mid-air, so you this attack works best at close-range to make sure the Barrel gets a kill. (Remember not to get too close as the explosion can kill you too) Holding down the right-click button will give your Explosive Barrel a 4 second timer. Letting go of the button will throw it. Use this attack to throw Barrels at opponents who are at a good distance away from you. This means not at close-range. Beware that you cannot throw another Barrel until the first has exploded, so make sure to use this attack wisely. When using the 4-second attack for the Explosive Barrel, work on your timing. When you should let go of the right-click button depends on how far your target is from you. Immediately throwing is best for killing players at long-range. It can even hit an opponent on the other side of smaller maps. Throwing when there's 2-3 seconds left is best for opponents at mid-range. The Explosive Barrel has the fastest rocket jump in the game. Tapping the fire-button while aiming below you will initiate a rocket jump. However , you will travel forward instead of upward. You can use this to get to the other side of bigger maps very quickly. Beware that rocket jumping will deal a hefty amount of damage, so you can only rocket jump once before you blow yourself up. Unlike the Bomb, the Explosive Barrel is slightly heavier and less bouncy. Make sure to adjust your aim for this. Trivia [ ] The Explosive Barrel previously does not deal any damage to enemies, the user can take damage from this weapon however. The Bomb's kill icon was used as a placeholder until the Explosive Barrel got a kill icon of its own.

It was made to capitalize with the increase in popularity of pistol carbines. To date, there is not much information about the FG-9, with the only semi-useful info being on its store page. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio (Outdated) 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The Falkor was added during the Sci-Fi Update of Arsenal. It has a sight that helps to aim at the opponents easier. However, it has a limited magazine of 17, and its hip-firing causes the spread to go high. Hip-firing is not suggested because of the amount of spread it has. Instead, using the holo-sight is very much suggested because it makes spread much better to control. The Falkor has an accessible sight when you right-click on your mouse for PC or press \"LT\" for Xbox . Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Accessible sight. Good close-quarters combat (CQC) damage. Larger magazine size compared to other pistols. Decent rate of fire. Cons: High spread upon hip-firing. Low minimum damage. Moderately slow reload. High muzzle flash while using sight, which may obstruct tracks. Tips [ ] The Falkor's accuracy is really, really bad. This limits its effective distance to only close-range. If you ADS with the Falkor, you can fire more accurately from mid-range. However, this weapon is completely useless at long-range, even if you ADS. Its spread is way too high for it to kill any opponents far away. Don't ADS when at close-range so you can easily aim and track the position of your target. Using ADS will limit your vision, allowing opponents to take advantage of you. The Falkor may have a fast reload, but it's not fast enough to let you reload in the middle of an intense fight. While reloading the Falkor, your opponent can easily kill you. Make your shots count. You only have 17 per magazine, and you'll often run out of ammo at the worst time possible. Make sure that whoever you're firing at can easily be killed. Opponents that are around a corner or are positioned above you are huge no-no's. Gallery [ ] ADS. Stage one development. Stage two. Stage three. Stage four. Falkor in real life without the sight. Trivia [ ] The weapon was revealed in the Arsenal Discord server during the Community-Ops Update development on May 3rd, 2020. The Falkor is one of several weapons able to aim down the sights, along with the MK18 , the M14 EBR , the DBS , the Vector , the Pulse Musket , and the DB Chauchat . The Falkor is also the first pistol to receive a sight attachment. The Falkor is one of the automatic pistols along with the G-18 , the Electric Revolver , the Little Tom , and the TEC-9 . When it was first released during the Sci-Fi Update , the Falkor had a whopping 30 bullets per magazine, and it shot way faster than today. Because of this, most of the playerbase considered the Falkor to be the best Pistol-class weapon in the game. However, this has since been nerfed to only 17 bullets per magazine and a slower firing rate when Summer Update III released, bringing us to today's Falkor. Some people often mistake the Falkor as an assault rifle due to the fact that it looks nothing like a traditional pistol.

It is being replaced as the service rifle of the French military by the HK416F. It is known by French troops as Le Clairon (The Bugle) due to its distinctive shape. The FAMAS is recognised for its high rate of fire at 1,100 rounds per minute. In-game information [ ] In-game, the FAMAS 's major strength is its fast rate of fire that can shred enemies fast. Along with the decent damage, players can shred in under five shots that hit. However, the drawbacks are the high spread penalty, lowering its utility at longer ranges, the slightly small magazine size, and the long reload time. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast rate of fire. Decent damage. Cons: Slow reload speed. High spread penalty. Small magazine size for an assault rifle. High recoil. Tips [ ] The FAMAS is only effective during intense fights that take place at close-range. It's best to avoid players with a Sniper Rifle or Marksman Rifle, which are more powerful at long-range. Be a bit more careful at mid-range because the spread is more noticeable at this distance. Try to get a kill within the first clip, as the FAMAS' slow reload will make you very vulnerable to opponents. Gallery [ ] Development of the current version of the weapon. FAMAS in real life. Trivia [ ] FAMAS, along with L86A3 , were revealed on Twitter on September 8th, 2019. The FAMAS' full name is the \" Fusil d'Assaut de la Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Etienne \", which is translated in English to the \" Assault Rifle from the Saint-Etienne Weapon Factory \". The design of the FAMAS in-game model appears as the FAMAS F1 , with a small trigger guard. In old Arsenal , the FAMAS model is the FAMAS G2 , a modernized version of the F1. It features the distinctively large trigger guard. Uniquely, these 2 models use 2 different types of magazines. The F1 uses a proprietary magazine, while the G2 uses standard AR-15 magazines. When this weapon was being tested, it would only do as little as 2 damage from far ranges excluding headshot. This was a bug in the Community Testing Environment version, and developers fixed it. The FAMAS is one of the 6 bullpup weapons in the game along with the AUG , L86A3 , P90 , Dual Shotguns , and the Tavor . The FAMAS is also featured in \" Counter Blox \", another game developed by ROLVe . Before the weapons were released, it can be seen in one of GDILIVES' (now JOHN ROBLOX) videos. It does only 4 damage to 2 at far range. The FAMAS is an ambidextrous gun, meaning left-handed shooters and right-handed shooters can use the FAMAS with equal ease. The FAMAS was introduced in 1978, replacing the MAT-49 for the French Military. This weapon was originally seen in Bluay's gun test. The firing sound of the FAMAS was taken from the Sturmgewehr 44 ( STG-44 ) from another ROLVe game, Unit 1968 . Both of them use the PM MD 63 Romanian AK (with a wooden grip) sound taken from a 2005 game Project Reality. Its model and sounds have remained unchanged since the September Update. Though, only the model of the weapon would eventually be changed in the 10 Year Anniversary Update The previous model lacks the grenade launcher sight, and 2 fire selectors (one in front of the trigger, and one behind the magazine release).

It takes up to two hits to kill a player. It will also launch nearby players on impact. Precision and accuracy with the rockets are required for a successful kill. Compared to most explosive weapons in Arsenal , the Firework Launcher deals lower self-damage, has less ammunition, reloads longer, deals less damage, and cannot jump as high, but it fires slightly faster. Due to weapon's tendency to launch other players on impact, the weapon may pose a greater threat in close combat, especially in small, closed spaces. It will lack in wide, open spaces. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Low self-damage when rocket jumping. Launching enemies may result in cheap kills via launching them off the map or into hazards. Fast projectile speed. Capable of rocket/recoil jumping . Cons: Very small 4-round magazine. Sluggish reload time. Fires a projectile, meaning that timing is key. Users can kill themselves if not careful. No one-shot capability, unlike most other explosive weapons. Launches players, making it harder to land a consecutive hit. Gallery [ ] Firework Launcher in real life as the M202. Trivia [ ] This gun is inspired by the M202 Flash , but shortened significantly for handheld use. The first firing sound effect is inherited from the Black Box in Team Fortress 2 . The previous firing sound effect was inherited from the Air Strike in Team Fortress 2. Its model and animations were used for the weapon now removed, the Incendiary Cannon an primary weapon for Arsonist in Typical Colors 2 . This is the signature weapon of the Uncle Sam skin .

The Five-SeveN was developed in conjunction with the popular weapon, P90 . It took FN 5.7×28mm, which was the same as the P90. The Five-SeveN is widely used all over (both in games and in real life) and is very common to see. In-Game Information [ ] Current Archived The Five-SeveN is one of the more powerful pistols in the game, with its high damage output, moderate recoil, and its magazine size similar to that of TEC-9 . It also has a very high rate of fire for being semi-auto (its rate of fire is compared to that of the G-18 ). However, one of two major drawbacks is the high spread penalty, making the weapon not doable for long-ranged combat. The weapon's rate of fire also causes the user to expend the magazine quickly if not careful. The Five-SeveN was added to the game in Gun Game since the beginning. However, it was removed in the Mega Update . It stayed in the game for over three years, though the weapon made its return in the 10 Year Anniversary Update after nearly 7 years. The stats are nearly identical to the current version, as it had low recoil. It had a high magazine of 20 rounds with ramp-up and high damage. The only difference is that the spread is much tighter compared to its current version, and it had a slower rate of fire. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Current: [ ] Pros: High magazine capacity. High damage at close range. Very high rate of fire. Cons: High spread. Low minimum damage. Magazine can be easily expended due to its fast fire rate. Archived: [ ] Pros: Low spread. High magazine capacity. High damage in CQC. Cons: Slow rate of fire. Low minimum damage. Tips [ ] The Five-SeveN is incredibly deadly at intense fights. However, its main weakness is range , due to its damage falloff and spread. To make the most of this weapon, approach closer to enemies before firing to rampup your damage. Its best performance is 3 bodyshots or 2 headshots, at close range. Its fast firing speed dominates against other Pistols and rivals most SMGs, so don't be afraid to take them on. Trivia [ ] This is another weapon from CS:GO that is also used in Counter Blox as well. The current Five-SeveN has the highest RPM out of all the pistols in the game. This can be observed by holding down the fire button on mobile. In the Classic gamemode , the Five-SeveN is the very first weapon to use.

Flamethrowers saw use in modern times during World War I and more widely in World War II as a tactical siege weapon against fortifications and enemy emplacements. Most flamethrowers in the military use liquid fuel, typically either gasoline or diesel, but commercial flamethrowers are generally blowtorches using gaseous fuels such as propane; gases are safer in peacetime applications due to the less mas flow rate of the flames and can dissipate faster. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The Flamethrower is one of the earliest weapons added in Arsenal . It was re-added in the Summer Update II . The Flamethrower is a powerhouse in close range; its fast afterburn and fire rate combined can obliterate an enemy that is unfortunate enough to get close to it. In addition, it is accompanied by its large magazine of 150, making it a weapon that is to be feared when in range of it. The Flamethrower, however, has a limited range of use, meaning that long-range attacks can't be performed using this weapon, which can be a problem since most players won't try to get close to a player holding the Flamethrower and would most likely kill them from a distance, rendering it ineffective. In addition, the slow mobility makes it easy for someone to quite run away when they are ambushed. Therefore, to effectively use this weapon, players must be caught off-guard and ambushed before they have time to react. Luckily, the afterburn can be a blessing here. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast afterburn. Large magazine size. Very low ammo consumption. Decent rate of fire. Cons: Low damage, including afterburn. Afterburn can be stopped by picking up a health pack. Very limited range. Long reload time. No headshot multiplier. User runs slower. Tips [ ] The Flamethrower can hit multiple enemies at once, so target groups of enemies rather than individuals if it's possible. The Flamethrower is best used if you sneak behind an opponent and burn them from behind, rather than confronting them head-on. This weapon loses to almost every other weapon in Arsenal if in a direct confrontation, so ambushing is recommended. If you're being shot at, equip your Knife and run away and find a different route to your opponents. Not doing so will make you an easy target to kill. If you die before you can finish off a player, the afterburn effect of the Flamethrower will let you be credited as an assist if a teammate kills your burning opponent. Do mind that afterburn will not be as effective if your opponent is still near full HP. It would just be a mild inconvenience to them. You'll be guaranteed a kill through afterburn if your opponent is approximately around the range of 20 HP. Gallery [ ] Previous model, blue Previous model, red Previous model, yellow Previous model, green Current Flamethrower stage one development. Stage two. Stage three. Stage four. With multiple grips. Trivia [ ] The current model of the Flamethrower was created back and was revealed in the Arsenal Discord server on May 25th, 2020. The previous Flamethrower model was inherited from Typical Colors 2 , used by the Arsonist class. According to EMIRPERIF, the Flamethrower is based on three games. One of the more noticeable ones being the Far Cry - Series flamethrower model, the others are still being researched. The Flamethrower, the Tavor 's Incendiary shells, the Spellbook , the Acid Spitter , and the Flaming Pumpkin are the only weapons to have the afterburn effect. Much like Acid Spitter, Flamethrower can be broken in any approaches: If the magazine is emptied, the Flamethrower would continuously fire with single shots as the magazine goes by negative. This would later be fixed in the Halloween Update II: Part II . In the currently inactive gamemode Juggernaut , the Flamethrower does not do any damage against the juggernaut or as the juggernaut. This has been fixed after. The afterburn doesn't instantly kill the player once the damage hits 100 or more when the Christmas Update II: Part II came out. This was later fixed on January 5th, 2021. This also affects the Acid Spitter and Flaming Pumpkin . Players using the weapon can kill spectators in any positions. It used to be the signature weapon of Garcello skin .

The Flaming Pumpkin seems to have a glowing part inside its model. It also has a projectile arch, but that is not a problem due to it having a splash damage and afterburn abilities. The Flaming Pumpkin runs on an ammo pool of 50. The users have to throw the Flaming Pumpkins at the enemies or near the enemies due to their reason. It has a fire effect which can burn enemies with its afterburn effect while it deals a damage of around 45. Throwing it near the enemies can also damage the enemies from the splash damage, and can summon the fire on the ground from it which can also burn enemies when they walk into it. However, when throwing the Flaming Pumpkin without caution, the user can also damage themselves from the splash damage with its afterburn effect, which also damages them. It can be easily be stopped when the user picks up a health pack. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Somewhat high damage. Enemies being affected by fire can give away their location. Summons a pool of fire that gives users an afterburn effect upon walking into. Fast throw rate. Fire pool stays longer. Cons: Afterburn deals a low damage of four per tick. Users can easily kill themselves if not careful. Trivia [ ] This weapon, the Spellbook , the Tavor with incendiary rounds, the Flamethrower and the Acid Spitter are the only weapons that have an afterburn effect. The Flaming Pumpkin is currently the only weapon that can summon a hazard. The model is re-used from the armor that the Grug skin is using and the Pumpkin Staff melee. The Flaming Pumpkin is the signature weapon for Grug skin. The afterburn damage used to be broken. This was later fixed on January 5th, 2021. This weapon was removed due to it intending to be buffed, but instead triggering the anti-cheat.

It fires 9x19 Parabellum rounds and fire rate of 1200 RPM. In-game Information [ ] In-game, the FMG-9's high damage, low spread, large magazine size, fast reload, and fast fire rate allows destruction at any range. However, even though the FMG-9 has a high magazine capacity, the magazine is still easily expended due to its fast fire rate. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast rate of fire. High damage. Fast reload. Low spread. Higher than average magazine size for its class. Cons: Magazine is easily expended due to its fast rate of fire. Tips [ ] The FMG-9 is one of the best SMGs in the game, as its damage, fast firing speed, and nearly perfect accuracy will allow you to get a kill in no time. In fact, its only con where ammo is quickly used up can be ignored, because the pros will usually prevent this from happening. The FMG-9 can be used from any range, especially from longer distances! Do beware that there is a tiny bit of bullet spread, so you will need to space out your shots if you fire from long-range (across the map). Reloading the FMG-9 is fast enough to help you in an intense fight where you're currently being fired at. Gallery [ ] Inspect. Equipping animation Stage one development. Stage two. Stage three. Stage four. Stage five. FMG-9 in real life. Trivia [ ] FMG-9 was revealed in the Arsenal Discord on February 3rd, 2020. The FMG-9's action is blowback. The FMG-9 fully equips before the equip animation finishes. The FMG-9's kill icon used to be a placeholder. The FMG-9's own kill icon was given in May 19th, 2020. When pulling out the FMG-9, its breech (the back end which folds open) actually clips through the character's right arm in the viewmodel animation. Unlike in game, the actual FMG-9 did not leave its prototype stage, meaning that the gun was actually never widely produced. Magpul Industries has since come out in 2021 with two redesigned successors to the FMG-9, the FDC-9 (carbine variant) and the FDP-9 (pistol variant), which are set to be released in 2022.

During the Cold War the FAL was adopted by many countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), with the notable exception of the United States. It is one of the most widely used rifles in history, having been used by more than 90 countries. Because of its prevalence and widespread usage among the militaries of many NATO and first world countries during the Cold War, it received the title \"The right arm of the Free World\". It is chambered for the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge (although originally designed for the .280 British intermediate cartridge). The British Commonwealth variant of the FAL was redesigned from FN's metrical FAL into British imperial units and was produced under licence as the L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle. In-game Information [ ] The FAL is a powerful battle rifle: players can expect a weapon with similar performance to the SCAR-H ; that is, having similar damage stats, fire rate, and magazine size. The FAL has a minimum of 4 shots to kill, with headshots giving the weapon a 2-shot kill. Unlike the SCAR-H, however, the FAL has lower damage and lacks a scope. The magazine and fast fire rate, similar to the Potassium Power and SCAR-H , contradict, each other firing at a speed of 700 RPM, meaning players will need to make every shot count. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Decent reload speed. Fast fire rate. Somewhat low spread. Cons: Small magazine size. Magazine is easily expended due to its high fire rate. Somewhat slow movement speed. Gallery [ ] FN FAL in real life. Trivia [ ] The in-game model's fire selector is set to semi-auto despite being fired in full auto. This gun was designed by the Belgian armaments industry FN Herstal in the late 1940s and produced from the early 1950s till present. Official production by FN stopped in 1988, however licensed FAL rifles are still made by other companies alike. The British version of the rifle, the L1A1 , would be the UK's standard rifle until the bullpup L85. The FAL served famously in Africa, Asia, and South America. The gun was infamously used by the Colombian separatist group FARC . Despite the gun's reputation for reliability, gun tests showed that the Russian AKM and AK-74 were nearly three times more reliable than the FAL. The FN FAL is called \" The Right Arm Of The Free World \" due to its prevalence and widespread usage among the militaries of many NATO and first world countries during the Cold War.

Each of the barrels has its own iron sights, excluding the unused one in the middle. While being fired, a hammer/bolt device cycles back and forth on a track on top of the receiver, impacting an illuminated button behind the barrel that is currently in upright position. The weapon draws power from a glowing cassette contained within the frame of the weapon, partially seen through the vents on the cover. While being reloaded, the entire top and front half of the weapon hinges open, allowing the depleted energy cassette to be replaced. The Focus functions similarly to the Laser Rifle and Pulse Laser with its tracer shots, perfect accuracy and 60-shot capacity, but trades the insane fire rate for some extra damage per shot. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast fire rate. No spread or recoil. Large magazine size. Perfect accuracy. Cons: Somewhat low damage per shot. High ammo consumption rate. Tracer shot can give away the user's position. Somewhat slow movement speed. Tips [ ] The Focus is effective from any distance, as it is 100% accurate and does not have weaker damage based on distance. You can potentially use this as if it was a Sniper RIfle and hit an opponent from the other side of the map. The Focus has a fast fire rate, but in reality it only fires as fast as a Pistol-class weapon. In fact, the Focus has the slowest fire rate of all the Automatic Rifles in the game. This means you have an equal fighting chance with opponents using a Pistol, Marksman Rifle, or Sniper Rifle. However, you'll lose outright to any opponent using a Shotgun. Shots worth 20 damage will kill a full health opponent in 5 shots. However, headshots that deal 25 damage will kill them a bit faster within 4 shots. The Focus has a respectable reload speed of 3 seconds. However, this won't help during an intense fight where you're currently being shot at. Luckily, you don't need to worry about this too much since you have 60 shots per magazine. However, you should still keep an eye on your ammo as prolonged fights with individual opponents can deplete the magazine quickly. Gallery [ ] Submission by nettimato. Original concept art for the weapon. Early sketch from 2019. Trivia [ ] The weapon takes inspiration from Pulse Rifle from Dead Space , automatic variants of the Laser Rifle from Fallout 4 , FR-27 Sanction Flechette Rifle from Deus Ex: Human Revolution and the look and feel of energy weapons in Mad Paintball 2 . An earlier concept art for a similar multi-barrel energy weapon called Ion Blaster was also published to the Arsenal Discord in April 2019. It was supposedly intended to be a shotgun and it was essentially a bulkier version of the Focus barrel module sitting on top of a shotgun receiver. The Focus is the sixth weapon to be created by nettimato, first being the STEN , second being the Calico , third being the G11 , fourth being the TOZ-106 , fifth being the Dual Shotguns and seventh being the Stake Launcher . The Focus is the signature weapon for Cyber Punk and Tech-Head skins .

The Liberator was never issued to American or other allied troops, and there are few documented instances of the weapon being used for its intended purpose; though the intended recipients, irregulars and resistance fighters, rarely kept detailed records due to the inherent risks if the records were captured by the enemy. In-game Information [ ] The FP-45 Liberator is the third gun to appear in-game. Just like all guns in MURDER , the pistol has one bullet and an indefinite ammo capacity. Upon a hit, it will instantly kill the murderer. It can also be crafted once the player has collected five loot. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Instantly kills a player upon a hit. Able to crafted once the player has obtained five loot. Infinite ammo capacity. Cons: Only one round in the chamber. Kills a user if shot at an innocent.

Originally produced in 1986, the G-18 is a machine pistol–class firearm bearing a fire-control selector switch on the rear left side of the slide. Depending on which position of the switch, the pistol has a different firing mode. With the selector lever in the bottom position, the pistol fires fully automatically, however if the lever is in the top position, the pistol fires semi-automatically. Typically, the firearm is used with an extended 33-round-capacity magazine, although other magazines from the Glock 17 can be used, with available capacities of 10, 17, 19 or 24 rounds. The Glock-18, unlike all its other siblings, is only offered to military, law enforcement, and government organizations. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Trivia 5 Gallery 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] In-game, the G-18 is a powerful fast automatic pistol. The G-18 has similar headshot damage to the Hi-Power pistol at close range. However the players must watch out for the ammo as the very small magazine size of 18 makes the ammo very expendable when considering the quickest fire rate. Luckily, the reload is fast, so players can get back to battles easily. However the players should also watch for the spread, since the spread is also very unforgiving. Shooting with the G-18 for any more than a second at a time will result in a massive spread penalty that gives itself a spread larger than most shotguns. Because of this; tap-firing is highly advised as it saves ammo and prevents the spread penalty from ruining accuracy. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Extremely fast fire rate. Fast reload. High magazine capacity for a pistol. Able to hold fire. Deals the same damage from any distance. Cons: High spread upon holding fire. High ammo consumption rate. Low overall damage. Tips [ ] The G-18's gimmick of having automatic firing speed can be difficult for players to handle. It fires very quickly and the spread gets very high. This reduces the G-18's effective range to close-range. The fast firing speed will allow you to quickly kill opponents without them retaliating. The G-18 is notoriously infamous for running out of ammo at the worst time possible: while in the middle of an intense fight. Before you start firing, make sure you're in a good position against your target, such as an open area. If your target can hide behind the map's props or is on a higher platform, you will fail to kill them. This weapon does have a fast reload, so you can get back into the fight quickly. However, if your opponent has a stronger weapon such as a Shotgun, expect to lose the fight while reloading. Trivia [ ] Despite its name, the archived version of Arsenal G-18 model better resembles a Glock 26 and resembles G-19X In the current game. The G-18 currently uses the same kill icon as G-19X's. In real life, the Glock-18 can switch between semi-automatic and automatic. The G-18 currently uses the old G-19X's model in third person, albeit some minor differences. The Archived G-18 also uses the current G-19X in the view model. The G-18 is one of the automatic pistols along with the Falkor , the Little Tom , the Electric Revolver and the TEC-9 . The G-18 in ROLVe's other game, Counter Blox , is semi-auto with the option of switching to burst. Today, the Glock is the most popular pistol, with total sales exceeding 20 million units. Glocks are made of durable, high-strength polymer, with simple designs and having an automatic safety switch. Their exceptional reliability might explain their popularity. Before Glocks rose to fame, the most popular pistol was the M1911 . Gallery [ ] G-18 in real life. Archived G-18 in real life.

The Glock 19X combines the best features of two of its most popular and most trusted field-tested platforms. The full-size Glock 17 frame and the compact Glock 19 slide have joined forces to produce the ideal pistol for all conditions and all situations. The 19X comes in the coyote color with the first-ever factory colored slide, finished with an improved nPVD slide coating to prevent corrosion. Additional features include the GLOCK Marksman Barrel , no finger grooves, ambidextrous slide stop levers and lanyard loop. Included with the pistol is a standard 17-round magazine, two 17+2-round magazines and coyote-colored pistol case. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] In-game, the G-19X is a large-magazine pistol with a focus on hitting every shot with the weapon's perfect accuracy. It fires from a 17-round magazine and carries 3 magazines in reserve. It deals 27-40 damage upon a body shot and deals 33-50 damage upon a headshot at different ranges. The G-19X has perfect accuracy because it has no recoil and has very low spread, meaning that wherever the crosshair is pointed, the G-19X will hit it. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: No spread. Large magazine size and ammo count. High damage in close quarters. Fast reload. Cons: Moderately slow fire-rate for its class. Tips [ ] In conclusion, the G-19X is your all-round Pistol. It deals a fair amount of damage, only to be hampered by a moderately slow firing rate. This means you will have to be careful if it comes to intense fights. If your chosen target has a weapon that can fire quickly (such as other Pistols, or SMGs), then you can expect a losing battle. If possible, try being more sneaky around your opponents, instead of facing them head-on. If all goes well, you they won't notice you until your second or third shot. From longer distances, the G-19X takes four bullets to kill, even with headshots. At close-range, it only takes two or three. Take advantage of long-range combat as this weapon is 100% accurate. The big magazine size of 17 bullets and a fast reload makes the G-19X a good weapon for intense fights. Gallery [ ] In third person. G-17 in real life. Previous G-17 in real life. G-19X in real life. Trivia [ ] Today, the Glock is the most popular pistol, with total sales exceeding 20 million units. Glocks are made of durable, high-strength polymer, with simple designs and having an automatic safety switch. Their exceptional reliability might explain their popularity. Before Glocks rose to fame, the most popular pistol was the M1911 .

The G-19X in-game appears to fire a 9mm cartridge, as evidenced by the 17 round mag capacity. It can be chambered for a multitude of other cartridges asides from 9x19mm, including but not limited to 10mm Auto, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG. Formerly, the G-19X dealt 25 (35+ up-close) damage for a headshot at mid-long ranges and 22-25 body shot (30+ up-close) damage through in mid-long ranges. The previous G-19X's model looks similar to the G-18 in Arsenal Archived . The G-19X has the same model as the G-21 . The previous G-19X's firing sound was taken from the G-17 from Counter Strike: Source . The G-19X along with the Rocket Launcher , the Peacemaker , the Barrett , the AUG , the XR15 , the Trench Gun , and the DB Shotgun are the only primary weapons that appear in the Arcade gamemode. The G-19X is also one of two weapons that cannot be picked up. The other being the Knife . G-19X was originally called the G-17 . G-19X and the previous G-18's firing sound was taken from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2007 version) , which is used for the M9 in the game.

Compared to the Glock 20 chambered in 10mm Auto, the slide of the Glock 21 is lighter to compensate for the lower-energy .45 ACP cartridge. The standard Glock 21 magazine is of the single-position-feed, staggered-column type with a capacity of 13 rounds. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Trivia 5 Audio 6 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The G-21 is a high capacity and high damage pistol with a focus on hitting every shot with the weapon's perfect accuracy. It fires from a 13-round magazine and carries 3 magazines in reserve. It deals 45 damage upon a bodyshot and 56 damage upon a headshot at long ranges. It has zero recoil and zero spread, meaning that wherever the crosshair is pointed, the G-21 will hit it. This weapon also has a low fire rate, adding more to its focus on perfect accuracy; players utilizing the Glock will have to wait a brief period of time to fire again after every shot. This weapon is best used at range. It's best used to pick off enemies' health from a distance, as the perfect accuracy means it can be used at long range very effectively. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Decent amount of damage. Decent magazine size. Powerful damage range. Fast reload speed. No spread and recoil. Cons: Moderately slow fire rate. Tips [ ] Just like the other weapons in the Glock family, the G-21 is your all-round Pistol. Deals good damage, only to be hampered by a slow firing speed. Pick your targets carefully, depending on their current weapon. Because the G-21 fires slowly, opponents using other Pistols or SMGs are losing battles. The G-21 is one of the more stronger Pistols, so it can dominate intense fights as long as you land your shots. No matter the distance or if hitting headshots, this weapon only takes 3 shots at minimum to get a kill. Obviously, beware that it will lose against stronger weapons such as Shotguns. The G-21 can only win against weaker Pistols or Projectiles. Trivia [ ] The G-21 previously used the G-19X 's firing sound. This is the signature weapon of Anarchist skin . The G-21 has the same model as the G-19X. Today, the Glock is the most popular pistol, with total sales exceeding 20 million units. Glocks are made of durable, high-strength polymer, with simple designs and having an automatic safety switch. Their exceptional reliability might explain their popularity.

The rifle is noted for its use of caseless ammunition. It was primarily a project of West Germany, though it was of significance to the other NATO countries as well. In particular, versions of the G11 were included in the U.S. Advanced Combat Rifle program. In 1990, H&amp;K finished the development of the G11, intended for the Bundeswehr and other NATO partners. Although the weapon was a technical success, it never entered full production due to the political changes of German reunification and lack of procurement contract. Only 1000 units were ever produced, some of which made their way into the hands of the Bundeswehr. Ultimately, the German armed forces replaced the G3 with the G36 . In-game Information [ ] With high damage, a large 45-round magazine, the G11 is a weapon suited to a high power role. Players should expect a 4-shot kill at minimum, with a potential for a 2-shot kill should enemies be in closer ranges or being headshot at longer distances. However, the only major downside of the G11 is its fire rate; players will fire at a rate slower than that of even the slowest SMGs. This can be an issue if all shots fired do not connect, so this weapon requires very good aiming skills. The G11 has an integral scope that can be accessed by right-clicking, allowing greater use of it at longer ranges. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Scoping allows for better magnification. Scoping decreases spread and recoil. Large 45-round magazine capacity. Cons: Slower fire rate for its class. Hip-firing without scope has a high spread penalty. Hip-firing has moderate recoil. Long reload time. Tips [ ] The G11 is a very deadly weapon due to its hefty damage and huge magazine size. However, its biggest weakness is accuracy. Firing without using the integral scope makes it difficult to land your shots, so use the scope when possible. However, hip-firing (shooting without using the scope) is best reserved for targets at close-range, as scoping in will limit your vision and can get you killed. Distance is also a distinct, versatile advantage with the G11. You can use the scope to shoot targets at long-range accurately, while hip-firing at close-range deals enough damage to kill an opponent in two shots. Gallery [ ] In third person. Early version. G11 in real life. Trivia [ ] The G11 was finished in 1990, although the German reunification and lack of contracts meant that the weapon was never adopted by any military groups, and it was also deemed obsolete due to the production of the G3 . Only about 1,000 models were ever produced. The G11 in real life also has a burst firing mode. This model of the G11 seems to resemble the G11 K1 model. The G11's model was made by a Discord user and MAD STUDIO developer, nettimato, who also created the Calico , the STEN , the TOZ-106 , the Dual Shotguns , the Focus , the Stake Launcher and the Peppermint Rifle models. There is a flaw when unloading the G11, there should be a button behind the scope to release the magazine.

It was accepted into service with the Bundeswehr in 1997, replacing the G3. Since then, it has also been a popular export, and the G36 has seen active service in military and police units in several countries, including Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The G36 is gas-operated and feeds from a 30-round detachable box magazine. In-game Information [ ] In-game, the G36 functions similarly to the M16A1 or the AUG . Like the above-mentioned weapons, it has a very tight spread and a somewhat high rate of fire. The reload is fairly quick and the damage is slightly above average for its class. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Very tight spread. Above-average damage for its class. Somewhat high rate of fire. Very quick reload. Moderate magazine size. Cons: Moderately high recoil. Ammo expends quickly due to the high fire rate. Gallery [ ] G36 in real life. Trivia [ ] The variant of the G36 seen in-game is actually the G36C ('C' standing for 'Compact'), which is a subcarbine version of the standard G36. The G36's magazine have studs molded on it and can be locked with other magazines in order to reload quickly. The G36 can also use a 100 round Beta-C drum magazine. The gun's firing sound is taken from the Galil AR in Counter Blox . The G36 is used to show a player's weapon skin in the Locker . The G36's model is taken from another one of ROLVe's games, Unit: Classified, but untextured. Similarly, its reload and firing animations are also from Unit. It shares the same inspect animation as the Sako 85 .

G3SG1 rifles were produced from the G3's lines, by choosing individual rifles and modifying them both internally (triggers, fire modes) and externally (the addition of a scope and mount, bipod and cheek riser). Contents 1 In-game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Trivia 5 Gallery 6 Audio (Outdated) 7 Weapon History 8 Sources In-game Information [ ] The G3SG1 has low damage for a sniper rifle but it is an automatic sniper rifle and can easily destroy enemies with just one headshot. However, it is a heavy weapon, and as a result, players will move slower when holding this weapon. If they can deal with this movement speed, this weapon will shred their enemies. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Largest magazine size out of all sniper rifles. Will always one-shot kill to the head. Scope allows for better magnification. Fastest rate of fire in-class. Extremely low spread. No recoil. Cons: Slow movement speed. Sluggish reload time. Below average body damage for a sniper rifle. Scope tracer may giveaway user position Tips [ ] The G3SG1 has the fastest fire-rate of all the Sniper Rifles in the game. However, each shot deals little damage. However, as with every Sniper Rifle, a single shot on the head is an instant kill. The G3SG1 in particular loses to Automatic Rifles and Shotguns. The G3SG1 deals a flat damage of 38 per shot, so you can use this weapon from any distance. This means it takes 3 bodyshots to kill an opponent. The best distance to fire is from long-range, where you can simply scope in and shoot while your opponents will have trouble hitting you back. If firing from mid-range or closer, do not use your scope. This will make it easier to fight opponents who are jumping to and around you. Even with its fast fire-rate and big magazine size, you should still space out your shots. The G3SG1's reload is particularly slow. You can spam your shots if you see multiple opponents grouped up together. Especially in gamemodes where there's no promotion-on-kill mechanic such as Randomizer and Gun Rotation. Trivia [ ] The G3SG1's model is borrowed from \" Counter Blox \", another game developed by ROLVe . The G3SG1 is a DMR Variant of the normal G3. The SG stands for Scharfschützengewehr (\" Sharpshooting Rifle \"). This used to be the signature weapon for Phoenix, after replacing the AWP and before being replaced by the AKM . The G3SG1 was inspired by the gun with the same name in CS:GO . The G3SG1's old firing sound was the same as the one used by the G3SG1 from CS:GO . The G3SG1 is the second sniper to be added and one of the only three semi-auto snipers in the game. As with the MP5K and the UMP-45 , the G3SG1's firing animation incorrectly portrays the weapon. The charging handle moves backwards after every shot, where as in real life, it is non-reciprocating. The previous version of the gun was incorrectly equipped with a PSO-1 scope. This was later fixed in the current version, switching it to the Hensoldt Z24 scope. The G3SG1 was originally going to be added into the game during the development of Gun Game however it was left scrapped and later released to the archived phase of Arsenal . &#91; 1 &#93; Gallery [ ] G3SG1 in real life.

It is an early machine gun and a forerunner of the modern electric motor-driven rotary cannon. Contents 1 In-game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Trivia 5 Audio 6 Weapon History In-game Information [ ] The Gatling Gun is primarily colored beige with black barrels, and as it is a Machine Gun, it slows down the walking speed of any player who pulls it out. Unlike the other Machine Guns, the Gatling Gun has a fixed pattern of shots when fired. However, the majority of these shots shoot around the user's crosshair rather than indirectly. This means that when you start shooting, the spread is already high. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros High damage. High ammo capacity. Keeps its same accuracy over time. Cons Shoots around the crosshair instead of into it. Slow reload time. High spread. Very slow pullout speed. Tips [ ] The Gatling Gun has a very weird spread compared to the other Machine Guns. While its accuracy does not get worse the longer you fire, it still fires shots around your crosshair rather than into it. Due to this, the Gatling Gun when used at mid-range (and further) requires luck to land shots rather than skill, unless you figure out the fixed spread pattern. To guarantee that more shots will land, use the Gatling Gun at close-range. Pulling this weapon out will slow you down. Equipping your Knife to close the distance then switching back to the Gatling Gun may do the trick. The Gatling Gun takes 2 seconds to pull out before you can start firing. You'll have to hope that you don't promote to this weapon in the middle of an intense fight. Before turning any corners, pull out the Gatling Gun ahead of time so you'll be ready to kill any opponents. Its incredibly slow reload time makes the Gatling Gun a \"one-and-done\" weapon, as it prompts players to get a kill within the first clip, or face the consequences. If you don't want to wait out the slow reload, resorting to getting a backstab with your Knife can be an alternate solution. Trivia [ ] The Gatling Gun once had no reload sound. The firing mechanism requires the user to crank the lever but instead using default minigun animation.

This is a basic sword out of the bunch, with one special ability which is the double jump ability, like the Ice Stars or Illumina and given a x4 jump height. Players should use this as an advantage; one of the ways to do this is by throwing off the movement. When spawning at the top and fall to the middle, double jump to make sure the enemy doesn't know where you land or use it to gain an advantageous place in the map. Pros and Cons [ ] Pros: Double jump ability. Jump height is increased by x4. Cons: Lacks backstab mechanic. Trivia [ ] The sword is based off the Ghostwalker created by ROBLOX in 2010. Like the Ice Dagger , the Ghostwalker isn't wielder transparent. Obviously, it also does not give a transparency bonus for kill streaks with this weapon because players get a different sword for every kill in Swordfights. It is the signature weapon of the Festive Ghastelle, Festive Phantina, Ghastelle, Ghost of Developing and Phantina skins.

It is a golden reskin of the original Bow . It always appears as the 14th weapon in the Hard Mode gamemode. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros High damage. Charge mechanic allows for more damage the longer the fire is held. Decently fast charge time. Projectile will travel further on a higher charge level. Fall-off helps deal more damage. Demotes players on kill. Cons: Charging for too long will decrease the arrow's velocity and effectiveness. Bow shots cannot be pre-charged without efficiency being lost due to arrow overcharge. Trivia [ ] The Golden Bow originally demotes the player back to level one. The feature was actually unintentional. &#91; 1 &#93; This, along with the Golden Creagle , the Golden Musket and the Golden Bomb , are the only ranged weapons that demote on a kill.

The Golden Creagle is basically a golden reskin of the Creagle , as all of the weapon except for the grip is gold. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Trivia 4 Audio 5 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The Golden Creagle's fire rate is ridiculously fast, insta-kills, has perfect accuracy, no recoil, demotes on a kill and regenerates all of the ammo in its magazine upon killing. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: One-shot kill on any part of the body at any range. Virtually no spread and recoil whatsoever. Demotes on a kill. Insanely quick reload. Shoots every few milliseconds. Capable of fly ability. Explosive rounds. High magazine. Capable of rocket jumping . Trivia [ ] This, the Admin Launcher and Influencer Launcher are the only three developer-exclusive weapons in the game. They are all also the only secondary weapons in the game except for Fasticuffs and Very Long Bat . The Golden Creagle, along with the Golden Bow , Golden Musket , Golden Hush Puppy and the Golden Bomb , are the only non-melee weapons that demotes on a kill. The Golden Creagle is the only weapon that regenerates ammo upon killing someone. The Golden Creagle is at the center of controversy, as exploiters have been able to get their hands on this weapon, allowing them to sweep a server and win games in less than a minute after it starts. After the Golden Creagle was patched, if an exploiter equips it will automatically kick them, however it's now eliminated from the game's code. When a user is killed, the kill feed shows Aimer_Btw's avatar as the kill icon. The Golden Creagle is a secondary weapon, meaning that it takes the slot with the melee. This rearranges the hotkeys of the weapons. This weapon shared the same firing and reloading audios as the Deagle .

In gamemodes that involve the Golden Knife , it will be the second to last weapon, with the Golden Knife serving as the last one. However, in Legacy Competitive and in a few other gamemodes, the Golden Gun is the last weapon instead, though in Hard Mode, it is the 13th weapon. The Golden Gun can also be obtained randomly in Randomizer . The current Golden Gun is based on the Tanfoglio Thor pistol. The Golden Gun will always instantly kill an enemy with its 100 damage upon body shot and 125 damage upon headshot. It gives players two rounds for use, one for the magazine and one for reserve, with a reload time of roughly 3.5 seconds. The Golden Gun, upon killing an enemy, converts them into a golden statue. When you are 1 level away from achieving this weapon, the bottom center of your screen will have a message saying \"Golden Gun is next!\" There is a bug in gamemodes that skip the golden knife in which the \"Golden Gun is next!\" message appears one level before the Golden Gun is actually next. Legacy Competitive does not have this issue. As the Golden Gun can only carry a single round at a time, players will need to be extra careful to guarantee that their shot will hit, as they will be vulnerable during its long reload time. Luckily, players can pick up ammo packs to fill up their reserves when they run out. The Golden Gun in Arsenal Archived used the sound and the model of the Deagle , which caused it to have a faster reload. This didn't change the magazine with only one bullet. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Guaranteed one-shot kill. Perfect accuracy. Cons: Only one-round in the chamber and reserve. Long reload time. Only one reserved bullet. Tips [ ] The Golden Gun is arguably the most difficult weapon in the entire game (behind the Golden Knife ) to get a kill with, as its \"one shot at glory\" gimmick does not allow any mistakes. Its reload is incredibly slow, which makes it easy for opponents to kill you. You also only have two bullets, therefore two chances before you're left with only your Knife . The Golden Gun will only be effective if you carefully take aim. Even with its perfect accuracy, the Golden Gun is best at mid-range, where you can easily see your targets and have less chances of any bullets hitting you. Flicking your aim is an option, but this has less chance of success than carefully aiming. It is recommended that you work on your melee combat in case you run out of the Golden Gun's ammo. If you're skillful enough, you can easily get a backstab and reach the Golden Knife (or end the game, depending on your current gamemode). If melee combat isn't working out, the alternate solution is to find the nearest ammo box. As soon as you pick it up, immediately switch back to the Golden Gun , as it needs to reload before it can be shot again. Gallery [ ] In third person. Golden Gun in real life. The actual Golden Gun in the James Bond film, The Man with the Golden Gun. Archived Golden Gun in real life. Trivia [ ] The current model of the Golden Gun was revealed in the Arsenal Discord on January 10th, 2020. The previous version fired a 4.2mm \"dum-dum\" round, more colloquially known as a \" Hollow-point \". Ironically, the Bond series Golden Gun uses such rounds. The bullets themselves were made from gold. In reality, such a bullet would be so heavy that the round itself would need an extremely powerful propellant to make it fatal. As such, in reality, the gun would have massive recoil. Before the Community-Ops Update , the original model was based upon the Golden Gun from the James Bond franchise , particularly its depiction in the 1974 movie The Man with the Golden Gun . The Golden Gun along with the Musket , the RPG , the M79 , the M16A2 's grenade launcher, the Bow , and the Pocket Potassium are the only weapons in the game that carry a single round. This is the signature weapon of Gaslight Detective, Detective, and Bloxy Delinquent skins . In the Halloween Update , the Golden Gun can now be obtained in the Randomizer gamemode but can't grant the Golden Knife . The Golden Gun has the same body and headshot damage as the Sunflower Sun when it returned to Arsenal . This is one of many weapons which were revealed before they got added into the game including the L86A3 , the FAMAS , the Ice Stars , the FMG-9 , the Maxim-9 , the Tavor , the Micro Uzis , the Flamethrower , the Pocket Potassium , the Z80 , the Literal Gun , the Vector , the Pulse Musket , and the TP Launcher . The current model is based on the Tanfoglio Thor, a single-shot handgun based on the frame of a conventional 1911-style pistol. It fires various types of rifle calibers. The one in-game looks like it fires the .308/7.62 NATO round. In third person, the selected weapon skin will appear on the barrel of the gun if the player holding it has one equipped. However, in first person, the weapon skin won't appear. The Golden Gun makes an appearance in the RPG Event as a secret weapon/ability that the Delinquent can find after defeating a secret boss.

It is a golden variation of the original Hush Puppy , having similar traits to most golden weapons; being able to demote on a kill and being harder to utilize. Unlike its non-golden counterpart, it has an even slower firing rate and abysmal damage to make it worse, even being unable to instantly kill full health players on a headshot. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros [ ] Demotes players on kill. Has no spread and recoil. Decent reload speed. Firerate can be increased by double keying Cons [ ] Low bodyshot damage. Extremely slow fire rate.

The player's current Knife skin will have a gold color (any glowing parts of the skin will be yellow) when this weapon is obtained. Three regular hits, or one stab to a victim's back will result in a kill, and winning the game. The victim will turn into a golden statue when killed. Assists do not count as kills for this weapon, unless the target killbinds or accidentally kill themselves. So players will need to ensure a victim's death in order to count it as a kill. Unlike the regular Knife, players using the Golden Knife run slightly faster and have the additional ability to double jump . This allows for easy mobility and rooftop access to jump onto unsuspecting victims. Archived [ ] The Golden Knife does the same role except it cannot backstab, double jump, and does less damage. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Can instantly kill a player by backstabbing. User runs slightly faster. Double jump ability. Grants win upon kill. Demotes players on kill. Cons: Can only fight opponents that are at close-range. The user is easily killable by other weapons. Slow rate of stab. Tips [ ] The Golden Knife is the most important weapon in the entire game, as it's the only way to win a game of Arsenal (in most gamemodes, of course). To get better at using the Golden Knife, practice by using your regular Knife to kill opponents. The Golden Knife is all about stealth . Recklessly running to opponents will get you killed very quickly. Avoid confrontations with opponents unless you're in a good position/location to get a backstab. Stay hidden until you find a possible target that will guarantee you a kill. If you miss that backstab, you'll be killed. A prime target for the Golden Knife is a player that is all alone , and has not seen you yet. These players will be easy to backstab. It will be easier to kill a singular target, instead of a group of opponents. A target can't fight back if they don't know where you are, so make sure to stay out of their sight. Take advantage of your increased speed and double jumps. These new abilities will allow you to traverse across the map a lot easier. These abilities are also good for escaping opponents that are shooting at you, or make trickstabs a lot easier to do. Your double jump ability allows you to get to higher places you couldn't before, or even dodge bullets mid-air. Try not to expose yourself in open areas. Instead, run through high or low areas of maps that players normally don't run through. This will allow you find easy targets to kill. Examples of these areas would be: The sandcastle, or the roofs of the buildings in Beach . The glass table in the middle of Kitchen Khaos . The underground tunnels of Dizzy . The roof of the \"Stinky's Coffee\" building in Boulevard . The trees, or the area full of parked cars in Tuscan . Anywhere that's not the sewers level in Street Corner Remastered . \"Trickstabs\" will come in handy with the Golden Knife if your target isn't an easy kill. These include: Drop stab: jumping off a higher platform on a target down below, stabbing their back as you land. Matador stab: you run to a target, but just next to them. Once you're past them, flick your aim left or right (depending on which side your opponent is on) and backstab. Hurdle stab: you run to a target, jump, crouch mid-air to avoid bumping into your target, then flick your aim downards (and diagonally if you're off to the side) and backstsab. Do note that you will need to jump over your target's shoulders and not their head, as doing this trickstab while on their head will only count as a hit. Trivia [ ] The Golden Knife used to be able to headstab, dealing 150 damage in the face. This was quickly removed. This is the first melee weapon that allows its users to double jump, the second being the Squeaky Hammer . Getting a player's first kill with this grants the badge \"Golden Touch\" which awards a free character crate. This is a reference to the Greek myth of King Midas, in which everything he touched turned to gold. Another badge called \"Podium of Gold\" is granted when the top 3 players have the Golden Knife. The addition of the double jump for the Golden Knife was likely intentional with the introduction of the Summer Update 's Concussion Mania gamemode in tandem with the sheer dependence on luck due to the position of enemies before 03/06/20. This is the only weapon in which an assist (exception of assisted suicides) will not progress the player to the next level. The only knife skin that doesn't have a golden version is Fisticuffs. The Ban Hammer appears to have no golden version but it gets a slight reflection. The Golden Knife's image with Pencil skin on the kill-chart originally says \"WICK'D\" in yellow text. The Golden Knife is also based on the Golden Knife ability from CS:GO where if a player wins the points of arms race game mode, they will get a Golden Knife and will need to kill an enemy to win and gain XP points. The golden weapons, alongside their ability to turn their victims into gold upon death, may be a reference to Team Fortress 2's Golden Frying Pan and the Saxxy , the melee variants of which turn enemies into solid gold upon killing them.

It deals 99 damage to the body, not 1-shot killing a target at any range, far unlike its brothers. The golden musket also carries 1 round with a punishing 6-second reload time in addition to 4 bullets in reserve. The only thing special was the demotion, plus the one-shot kill headshot, therefore players should aim for the head when using it. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros Demotes players on kill. One-shot kill on the head. Cons Only one round in the chamber, so the weapon must reload every time after firing. Low reserve ammo. Only deals 99 damage on bodyshot. Grueling 6-second reload time. Tips [ ] The Golden Musket is an incredibly harder (and more annoying) version of the original Musket , as it only deals 99 damage for a bodyshot. However , there are multiple solutions to getting promoted from this weapon: A bodyshot, followed up with a single hit from your Knife will secure the kill and demote your opponent. Firing at an opponent and hope that a teammate gets you an assist. Firing at an opponent after you see one of your teammates shoot at them. Aiming for the head, although it will be more difficult against opponents using lighter weapons. Briefly camping in one spot so you can take your time to aim. It will be easier to get a headshot with the Golden Musket if your opponent is using a heavy weapon, which will make them walk slower. Keep an eye on what weapons your opponents are holding and pick the best choice. Heavy weapons include all Machine Guns and most Sniper Rifles. Just like the original Musket, if you cannot wait for the long reload, resorting to melee combat with your Knife is your only option. Hiding in an enclosed space will let you reload the Golden Musket in peace. In the end, you do not have to worry about using the Golden Musket, as it only appears in Hard Mode/Insane Mode and it rarely shows up in the weapon pool for Standard/Legacy Competitive. It also never shows up in Snipers Only. Still, it would be a good idea to remember the aforementioned tips just in case you have the misfortune of getting this weapon. Trivia [ ] Xonae confirmed this weapon is not supposed to be in Standard gamemode.

In-Game Information [ ] The Grease Gun is a very powerful submachine gun, seeming more akin to a rifle than an SMG. It has high damage, with a minimum of 32 at all ranges, ensuring that you will always have at least a four-shot kill. However, the Grease Gun has its drawbacks. It has a low rate of fire; even slower than most semi-automatic guns being spam-clicked. It also has a small magazine size of 20 rounds. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Low spread. Quick reload. Cons: High recoil upon continuous shots. Slow rate of fire. Small magazine capacity. Trivia [ ] The variant of M3 in-game appears to be the M3A1, as evidenced by the lack of a cocking lever and the use of the character's hand to pull the bolt back manually. Normally in real life, the Tommy Gun is more accurate than the M3A1, but in-game, the M3A1 is more accurate than the Tommy Gun. In-game, the Grease Gun incorrectly holds 20 rounds in a 30 round magazine, likely due to balance reasons. When it was first brought into the game, its damage was very high, allowing people to often score multi-kills. The M3 is an automatic, air-cooled blowback-operated weapon that fires from an open bolt. Constructed of plain 0.060-inch-thick (1.5 mm) sheet steel, the M3 receiver was stamped in two halves that were then welded together. Left over M3 magazines from WWII were used by the MAC-10 during the early production to reduce costs.

It fires a laser beam using a magnetic repulse which creates a semiautomatic contrast in order to launch the energy projectile. Contents 1 General Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Trivia 5 Audio 6 Weapon History General Information [ ] With an 8-round magazine, this weapon is a threat comparable to the Deagle , trading in damage for perfect accuracy and more rounds. As an accuracy-based weapon, this pistol has an unusual trait of being efficient at long-range despite its lowered damage. It one shot-kill on the head and has ramp-up that increases damages based on closer proximity to enemies. Because of its ramp-up, it is best to take advantage of the increased damage at close range to deal maximum damage that can sweep a player in two body-shots. However, more conservative players may pick off a headshot at long range, which can be easily done due to its perfect accuracy. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Perfect accuracy. Fast reload. Quick movement speed. Cons: Tracer shot can give away the user's position. Small magazine size of 8. Somewhat slow rate of fire. Takes 3 shots to kill a person if body-shot. Tips [ ] The Handcannon performs best if picking off a single target instead of being swarmed by multiple opponents. It has a slow firing speed, so you will not be able to take on more than one enemy at a time. Focus on individual fights instead. Keep a good distance from opponents to make it easier to land shots with the Handcannon. Getting too close may make it confusing for you on where to shoot. The Handcannon loses to Shotgun-class weapons, so beware of this. Despite its perfect accuracy, it is recommended not to use this like a Sniper Rifle from long-range as 38 damage can only do so much. Stay within mid-range and the Handcannon will be effective. Trivia [ ] This weapon's model was used as a base for the Flare Gun for Typical Colors 2 , borrowing animations and even parts of the model. The previous firing sound was taken from the Diamondback from Team Fortress 2 . It is the signature weapon of the Castlers, Cyber Hero, Holiday Castlers, and Ronaldinho Soccer skins . It was the signature weapon of Ace Pilot in the August Update , but was changed back to the MP5K in the Anniversary Update and was changed to the P90 in the Christmas Update . The Handcannon was also reworked into a ramp-up style weapon in the September Update, formerly being a fixed 42 damage to the body. The Handcannon bears a vague resemblance to the 45MW.TRG Dominator firearm from Psycho-Pass . The Handcannon is ROLVe developer Castlers' favorite weapon. Developers have the unique ability to carry a second weapon of their choice in the game. Castlers' second weapon is the Handcannon. The Handcannon makes an appearance in the RPG Event as the weapon used by the Commander Unit enemy.

It bears resemblance to the standard M67 Frag Grenade made by the US army used in many wars after World War II. In-game Information [ ] It used to be the weapon before the Golden Gun until it was removed from the Mega Update . This is different from the Bomb because the bomb has a brief delay until it can be used again after it explodes, while the HE Grenade has a very long delay. Pros and Cons [ ] Pros: Able to hit enemies upon throwing the grenade towards them. Ability to cook the grenade by holding it. Does not explode while cooking the grenade. Cons: 1 pre-use grenade. Long delay before using it again after each throw. Players can&#160;easily dodge the grenade. Users can&#160;easily kill themselves if not careful. Trivia [ ] The HE Grenade was originally going to be added into the game during the development of Gun Game however this was left scrapped and later released to the ALPHA phase of Arsenal . &#91; 1 &#93; Weapon History [ ] 04/21/16: Added into the ALPHA phase of Arsenal . 08/06/16: Taken to the archived phase of Arsenal . 07/06/17: Changed to being the final weapon before the Golden Gun. 11/27/18: Removed from&#160; Arsenal .

Besides being the most popular in the Wild West era, the Henry Rifle was also a prized weapon in the American Civil War, and was one of the main weapons used in the Battle of Little Bighorn. However, its design made it unable to attatch a bayonet , one of the most useful attatchments in historical battles. It functions differently compared to other existing Shotguns. After a shot, the user has to push out the lever, located at the bottom, to eject the shell and then pull the lever back to cock in a new one. When reloading, the user has to hold the lever open and use their free hand to load shells into the chamber located at the side of the weapon's barrel. In-game Information [ ] The Henry Rifle is a mid to long-range weapon, due to the weapon's two-shot kill minimum at all ranges, a sluggish rate of fire owing to the lever-action mechanism, and a one-shot kill potential at all ranges upon a headshot. However, due to the slow rate of fire, aiming precisely with this gun is likely required. It can be compared to the Spencer Carbine , as they are both lever-action rifles that allow players to double jump by simply jumping in midair. However, the difference is that the Henry Rifle has the ability to reload 1 by 1, unlike the Spencer, which requires waiting for its long reload time. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. No spread and is completely accurate at all ranges. 1-by-1 reloading allows topping off. Capability of double jumping allows for greater movement. Headshots can one-shot. Cons: Slow rate of fire. High recoil. Sluggish empty reload. Low magazine capacity of 6. Tips [ ] While the Henry Rifle does have the ability to double jump, make sure not to overuse it. This weapon only shoots one bullet, so extreme movement like double-jumping may make you miss more shots. Use the double-jump ability to instead find higher places to shoot from, and escape opponents while reloading. The Henry Rifle deals 87 damage from any range , so it is recommended that you try to shoot from a distance rather than up close to opponents. Trivia [ ] The model for the Henry Rifle is incorrectly modeled after the Winchester 1873 rifle, as the use of a loading port on the right side of the receiver can attest to, along with the distinctive wooden handguard. The actual Henry Rifle did not feature a wooden foregrip and was reloaded by a muzzle-bottom tube instead of being loaded by the breach. The Henry Rifle is named after its creator, Benjamin Tyler Henry. Production of the Henry Rifle lasted from 1860 to 1866 under the New Haven Arms Company. The firing sound effect for both the Henry Rifle and the Spencer Carbine originated from the Sniper Rifle in Team Fortress Classic . The Henry Rifle can fire a variety of cartridges such as .44 Magnum, or the .44 Henry Rimfire. Prior to the Showtime! Update , the Henry Rifle didn't have the double jump ability. It is the signature weapon of the Wanderer and Lone Wanderer skins . The models, sounds, and animations for this weapon are also used for a primary weapon of choice for the Flanker in Typical Colors 2 , known as the Perceptionist , although it acts like a shotgun and not a rifle. The double jump ability is most likely a reference to the Flanker from TC2 , a former ROLVe game. The Henry Rifle is the sole weapon in the Froggy's Apartment quest. This references popular carnival game culture where target shooting games use the Henry as the weapon platform mounted on the stalls. Gallery [ ] Henry Rifle in real life.

It was based on a design by American firearms inventor John Browning, and completed by FN Herstal's Dieudonné Saive, as Browning died before his design could be finalized by him. The name Hi-Power was chosen for its relatively high magazine size of 13-rounds, which at the time was twice the size of more contemporary pistols' magazines. It has been used by many armed forces and was produced for 82 years before its discontinuation by Browning Arms and FN Herstal. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio (Outdated) 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The Hi-Power is a quick, above-average weapon firing from a 13-round magazine, acting as a better version of the M1911 . Players can expect to kill with two shots to the head at all ranges, and can always expect a three-shot kill at close-quarters combat (CQC). The weapon quickly reloads from an average magazine capacity, helping to ensure minimal downtime between the magazine dumps. As with other pistols, rapidly firing the Hi-Power will increase the weapon's spread to a point that it is nearly unusable at longer ranges. Tap-firing with the Hi-Power can help players kill at long ranges. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast rate of fire. High maximum headshot damage. Fast reload. Somewhat large magazine capacity. Cons: High spread upon continuous shots. Magazine is easily expended due to its rate of fire. Tips [ ] The Hi-Power is one of the more accurate Pistols, although its spread becomes useless around the 7th shot. The Hi-Power is great from low- and mid-range. You can easily spam shots from either of these distances and nearly every shot you make will land. It also reloads quick, allowing you to continue shooting in the middle of an intense fight. If you're coming to Arsenal as a Typical Colors 2 player, you should note that the Hi-Power is similar to the Pistol you know, but it's slightly different: Unlike TC2's Pistol, for the Hi-Power you'll have to rapidly click the fire button on your device to shoot instead of holding it down. Beware that the Hi-Power is less accurate than TC2's Pistol, so you'll need to space out your shots a bit. The Hi-Power is more powerful, as its damage range is 27-45 compared to the Pistol's 7-22. Shooting an opponents head makes you deal crit damage, too. The Hi-Power is a slightly better version of the Pistol for Flanker. In TC2, its ammo is 12 / 36. The Hi-Power in Arsenal has an ammo pool of 13 / 39. Gallery [ ] Hi-Power in real life. Trivia [ ] The Hi-Power designer, John Browning, was the same person who designed the M1911 , along with many others. The Hi-Power's weapon model appears to have been reused from Typical Colors 2 , found in-game as the Pistol , as the Flanker and Mechanic 's stock secondary. At the time, the Hi-Power had almost two times the magazine capacity of contemporary pistols, notable examples being the Luger and the M1911 , firing from 8 and 7-round box magazines respectively. This is the reason the weapon is named the Hi-Power. The Hi-Power was the most used military pistol, having been used by 50 different countries. After 82 years of production, it was discontinued in 2017. The weapon is referred to as the HP, GP, BAP, or BHP, but is mainly called the Hi-Power . The Hi-Power's firing sound was taken from the game, Day of Infamy . The Hi-Power's firing sound is most notably used a placeholder for new, just released weapons and is used for the Literal Gun and the Origami Gun .

It is a modified Smith &amp; Wesson Model 39 with a slide-locking mechanism and a wider grip frame for its 14-round mag. The reason for its slide-locking mechanism is to keep the gun itself quiet while firing, as to not give the user away to any sentries or watchdogs nearby, which this weapon was designed to take out, most importantly the latter, hence the nickname \"Hush Puppy\". Unfortunately, more information regarding the use of the Mk22 is hard to come by because of the confidentiality that surrounds this weapon. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio (Outdated) 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The Hush Puppy was added to Arsenal during the Mega Update . The Hush Puppy has a powerful amount of damage. Players would be rewarded with a whopping 297 damage if they aim for the head. Along with no spread, players that aim their crosshair at the players will guaranteed land their shot. Landing a shot on an opponent's body can be easily used for an assist if a teammate is around. The weapon also has a fall-off, making it a one-shot kill at close range. However, even in a long range encounter it is still of great use. While it might not kill an enemy on the first shot, it still does a huge amount of damage, basically guaranteeing that you'll at least get an assist. The weapon doesn't come without problems. Its slide-locking mechanism means that players will need to manually re-chamber the weapon after every shot, resulting in a substantially lowered fire rate. The slow fire-rate makes the weapon particularly difficult to use for those unable to land a hit. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Has no spread and recoil. Silenced shots do not give away the user's spot for enemies. Firerate can be increased by double keying. Cons: Slow fire rate. Small magazine size. Slow reload speed for its class. Tips [ ] The Hush Puppy is unique compared to the other Pistols: It cannot spam its shots. There's a 0.5 delay between each shot. It's 100% accurate. Its reload speed is a lot slower than the other Pistols, meaning that you're very vulnerable when reloading during intense fights. It deals enough damage to be effective from any range, making it one of the most versatile Pistols in the game. The Hush Puppy deals 99 damage at close-range, and for some distance at mid-range. Any further and the damage will have fall-off. But don't get too close! Remember that the Hush Puppy has a slow firing speed, so you cannot get kills quickly. Stay at a good distance and you'll be more likely to not get shot. Of course, headshots will insta-kill. Since the Hush Puppy has no spread, it's practically sub-classed as a Sniper Rifle. It deals a ton of damage, even from far away. At longer ranges, crouch down to slow down your movement and make it easier to aim. Beware that you can easily be attacked if an opponent finds you. Because its normal damage range is 81-99, it will take two shots to kill an opponent. However, you can just shoot once and wait for an opponent to get you an assist. Alternatively, you can land a shot, then land a regular hit from your Knife to demote them. Talk about being too close for comfort! If you're coming to Arsenal as a Typical Colors 2 player, note that the Hush Puppy is not like the Silenced Pistol that Agent uses. The Silenced Pistol fires fast, very much unlike the Hush Puppy. This means you'll need to make your shots count instead of spamming them. On the bright side, the Hush Puppy deals massive damage against enemies compared to the Silenced Pistol. Gallery [ ] In third person. Hush Puppy in real life. Trivia [ ] The Hush Puppy (Mk22) was one of Naked Snake's starting weapons in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater . It works nearly the same in-game as it does in Arsenal ; the only main differences being that in MGS3, it held tranquilizer rounds, and the suppressor was detachable. Also, the gun is the signature weapon of the skins Snake Eater (who is a reference to Naked Snake), Veteran, and Fallen Veteran. Getting a headshot kill with the Hush Puppy while wearing the Snake Eater skin will grant the player the Virtuous Combatant badge, which is a reference to the Virtuous Mission in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. The Hush Puppy is the first weapon with a silencer to be added to the Mega Update of Arsenal . The Hush Puppy is also one of the 6 weapons which have a silencer, the others are the MP9-S , the MK18 , the Mauser Carbine , Maxim-9 , the Sako 85 , and the Vector .

As its name suggests, it is a light-blue, icy reskin of the Dagger melee. It also has a little light blue sparkle affect to it. It is the only weapon in the Swordfights gamemode that has the ability to backstab. It is quite considered the most powerful melee, having a 3500 damage which is extremely high for a melee, along with a backstab ability allowing it to instantly kill a player. The Ice kill effect is also applied to this weapon. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Capable of backstabbing. Instantly kill the target on hit. Cons: Does not demote of kill. Extremely short attack range. Trivia [ ] The Ice Dagger deals the most damage out of every melee weapon in the game, including Swordfights, doing 3500 damage on the body and 300 on the back. The Ice Dagger is based off the Icedagger gear created by ROBLOX in 2012. Like the Ghostwalker , the Ice Dagger is not wielder transparent.

They are a projectile weapon and run on an ammo pool system instead of a magazine system like the Minigun or M40 . It has an arch, and the arch is similar to the Razor Bomb . This weapon is best suited for mid-range, similar to the Crossbow . This weapon allows players to jump twice in the air like the Spencer Carbine and Henry Rifle . The Ice Stars throw three shurikens per click, dealing 90 damage if all shurikens hit. Right-clicking or pressing the V key throws all three shurikens at once which deals 120 damage, despite only throwing three, insta-killing the enemy; on mobile, players can press the scope button to throw all three shurikens at once. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast projectile speed. Fast fire rate. High ammo pool. No reloading required. Double-jump ability. Burst-throwing allows multiple shots in one click. Insta-kill on burst-throwing. Cons: Projectile arches, making it harder to hit enemies at longer ranges. No headshot multiplier. Long delay between burst throws. Low damage for a projectile. Tips [ ] The Ice Stars' biggest advantage is its ability to burst-fire . This method is a lot stronger than the primary-fire option with the potential to insta-kill. However, this lacks range. The burst-fire attack resembles a Shotgun, powerful but cannot go far. Try not to use the primary-fire attack (which throws out one star at a time) as much as possible, as it can easily be dodged. Save the primary-fire attack for enemies at a distance, especially at mid-range. Take advantage of its ability to double-jump. You can use this ability to get closer to enemies or to dodge enemy attacks while in mid-air. This especially comes in handy with a tricky projectile weapon like the Ice Stars. Here's a little secret: newer Arsenal players using the Ice Stars do not know the ability to burst-fire exists. Use these players to get an easy kill, especially if you have a difficult weapon to get a kill with (such as the Musket ). Gallery [ ] Development of the weapon that should've been snowflake stars. Model of the weapon. Trivia [ ] The Ice Stars model was revealed by EMIRPERIF in the official Arsenal Discord server on December 18, 2019. EMIRPERIF originally going to make snowflake stars based on a ROBLOX gear, Silver Snowflake as suggested by Dogutsune however it ended up as ice stars instead. This, the Spencer Carbine , the Henry Rifle , the Golden Knife , the Lever Shotgun , the Ghostwalker and the Illumina are the only weapons in the game that have the double jump ability. The Ice Stars' current mechanics seem to draw inspiration from the Overwatch character Genji, a cybernetic ninja who is also capable of double-jumping and throwing volleys of shurikens. The Ice Stars currently has no firing sound. It is almost never worth it to use the left click fire because right click usually deals more than three shurikens, and throws shurikens faster Audio [ ] Current Firing https://robloxarsenal.fandom.com/wiki/File:Ice-stars-burst.ogg Previous Firing https://robloxarsenal.fandom.com/wiki/File:Ice-stars.ogg Weapon History [ ] 12/20/19: Added into the Christmas Update: Part II of Arsenal. 05/16/20: The weapon mechanic changed: Fire rate buffed.

It is particularly known for being the first use of an inertia recoil operation in a firearm. In-game Information [ ] The Inertial Shotgun 's statistics rival that of the Trench Gun . It boasts high per-pellet damage that does not fall-off as harshly compared to other shotguns, allowing this weapon to be used out to longer distances. On top of that, the weapon's semi-automatic mechanism increases its rate of fire to top tier levels. However, the Inertial Shotgun has a low magazine capacity. Combined with the weapon's rate of fire, players can expend their ammo in a matter of moments should they continually miss their target. Fortunately, the weapon's 1-by-1 reloading allows one to top their magazine off at any opportune moment. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast rate of fire. High damage with a low fall-off. Tight spread for a shotgun. 1-by-1 reloading allows topping off. Cons: Small magazine size. 1-by-1 empty reloads are slow. Higher recoil for a weapon of its class. Tips [ ] The Intertial Shotgun can be used easily when shooting, but its other aspects (such as the recoil and reload) may be tricky to deal with. If possible, avoid reloading this weapon and get a kill early. Its reload is slow and it will leave you vulnerable during intense fights. This weapon is very good at mid-range due to its tight spread of pellets, and can even hit opponents who are both far and on a higher platform. This also applies to any opponents currently recoil jumping . Gallery [ ] The Inertial Shotgun in real life with a full stock and long barrel. Trivia [ ] The in-game model compared to the real model has a sawed-off barrel and no stock. The Inertial Shotgun was produced for a short time of 1 year (1908-1909) and only 5,000 of the models were produced. It is the signature weapon of Gal skin .

It was an altered Baseball Launcher which fired eggs that could instantly kill opponents, rewarding players who got hit with the Video Star badge related to the Egg Hunt 2019 event. The Influencer Launcher was discontinued after the 2019 Egg Hunt event. It can still be spawned in by using a custom gamemode in private servers and can still be fired, however the projectile does not appear. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast fire rate.

          "raw": "36 (150) Gamemodes All Special Backstab Demotion Kill Icon The Knife is a melee weapon. The Knife deals 36 damage on-hit. When a player kills an enemy with a Knife, the victim gets demoted, losing a level and going back to their previous weapon. It is available at every level except Level 32 in Standard and Gun Rotation, and Level 16 in every other gamemode excluding Brickbattle, Clown Infection, and Swordfights. The Knife has a backstab mechanic, in which if a player manages to stab an enemy whose back is facing towards them in a 135-degree angle, it will instantly kill that enemy. Additionally, the Knife allows for a fast movement speed while active, allowing for extra mobility during battle. The Knife also has different skins that can be equipped in the locker , each with their own golden counterparts (except for the Fisticuffs and Ban Hammer). Knife skins are merely cosmetic and have no differing statistics. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Can instantly kill a player by backstabbing. Demotes players on kill. Fast movement speed while active. Cons: Can only fight opponents that are at close-range. The user is easily killable by other weapons. Slow rate of stab. Tips [ ] The Knife is very useful when it comes movement . If you equip it, you can run faster and jump slightly higher. The best time to pull out your Knife is when you have a heavy weapon that slows down your movement speed, such as a Machine Gun or a Sniper Rifle. If your current weapon is a Pistol, there's no need to pull out the Knife to run faster, as your speed will stay the same. Be careful when running with your Knife, as it makes you the most vulnerable to enemy players. If you're running with your Knife, make sure to pull out your current weapon before turning any corners to avoid getting killed by any enemies you meet. Try getting kills with your Knife if you see any opportunity to. Be careful of this, as any reckless attempts with the Knife will heavily punish you. Knife kills will slow down the progress of opponents as they get demoted to their previous weapon, but you get promoted to your next. Getting a Knife kill on someone with the Golden Knife will also prevent them from winning the game, although this is very risky. The best time to get kills with your Knife are: When the opponent's back is turned towards you. If the opponent has not seen you yet. If the opponent has a weak weapon, such as a throwable projectile or a Pistol. If your weapon needs to reload, but you dealt enough damage so you can demote them with one hit from your Knife. \"Trickstabs\" are more difficult, but rewarding ways to kill with the Knife. These should only be attempted as a last resort or if you're confident it will work: Drop stab: jumping off a higher platform on a target down below, stabbing their back as you land. Matador stab: you run to a target, but just next to them. Once you're past them, flick your aim left or right (depending on which side your opponent is on) and backstab. Hurdle stab: you run to a target, jump, crouch mid-air to avoid bumping into your target, then flick your aim downards (and diagonally if you're off to the side) and backstsab. Do note that you will need to jump over your target's shoulders and not their head, as doing this trickstab while on their head will only count as a hit. Sky-ward stab: when a target jumps over your head, simply flick your aim upwards. Your stab will technically count as a backstab due to their back being directly on-top of your head. Aerial stab: this is one of the more complicated stabs, but it's very similar to the drop stab. Before stabbing, you will need an explosive projectile like the Rocket Launcher, a gun with explosive ammo, M16A2 as an example, or a gun with recoil jumping, such as DB Shotgun or Barrett. Launching yourself up in the air with the weapon, you'll be airborne through the sky. Meanwhile, look down to seek a potential target. Once you are close to that target, equip your melee and stab them once you land on their back. You will also have to time when you take out your melee, but it's recommended to do it right after you are airborne. You can also do the same in Concussion Mania. Gallery [ ] A red Solid Color Knife. Trivia [ ] In the Mega Update , the Butterfly Knife was used as the default melee. In the 2.6 Update , three other melees were added and the Butterfly Knife was replaced by the Dagger. However, there is a slight chance for the Butterfly Knife to appear in the locker immediately when first starting the game. Also in the Mega Update , the handle was pure black with some gray bolts attached between the blade and the handle. This was changed to pure shiny blue in 2.6 Update . Before in Arsenal Archived , the Knife dealt 20 damage per hit. Many Knife skins are based on popular media and pop culture, or are taken from Typical Colors 2 . The Energy Blade is likely inspired by the energy sword from Halo . The Saber is inspired by the lightsaber wielded by Star Wars character Kylo Ren . The Endbringer is heavily inspired by the Crucible energy blade from Doom Eternal . Da Melee is based on the Arsenal Discord moderator, Buildingssssss. The Delinquent Pop melee is a reference to popsicle figurines from the Blue Bunny Ice Cream company. The When Day Breaks melee is a reference to S.D. Locke's Proposal for SCP-001 known as When Day Breaks. The Annihilator's Broken Sword is taken from a Typical Colors 2 melee weapon named Broken Sword . There are exclusive melees that are only available to ROLVe staff members, such as the SpaceKatanaOLD, SuperSpaceKatana, the Equip, the Crucible, and the Moderation Hammer. The Moderation Hammer used to have the Ban Hammer's icon as a placeholder and its rarity being Promo before unknowingly changing to a blank icon and being promoted to the Admin rarity. The Moderation Hammer's inspect animation is bugged, where it will go inside the player instead of away from them. The Super Space Katana has no model which makes it impossible to use. The Crucible and Katar are the exact same melee as the Endbringer and Energy Katar, respectively, except the blade doesn't come out of the weapon in the equip animation. The default skin for the Knife, the Dagger, appears in Typical Colors 2 as the model for the Tunnel Rat weapon. The Knife itself also appears in Typical Colors 2 as a developer-only weapon where the user turns into the Delinquent . Just like in Arsenal , this weapon allows to user to insta-kill enemies upon backstab, and the user's weapon changes after each kill. Some content creators can be given exclusive melees by the developers. FusionJack_ was given the Gaster Blaster melee. The Knife's demote sound is taken from from CS:GO's Guardian gamemode where a player gets killed by an attacker during a round. The archived Knife is based off the CS:GO terrorist-side knife. The Pencil melee's icon was simply the word \"WICK'D\", as the Pencil is inspired from the John Wick movies. However, the \"WICK'D\" icon was changed to an actual icon of the Pencil in the Pre-Halloween Update II release. The Banana's kill-icon would turn yellow whenever the user got a backstab. The Bloxy melee is the only melee to have an unusual attached to it. The Newspaper melee had a glitch where the user could clip through walls by deploying it while looking up. The Fish melee is the first melee to have jiggle mechanics. When equipping the Moai melee, the vine boom sound plays. The Ban Hammer could've been obtained through the removed fake Admin Gamepass or the expired code \"hammertime\" The Butterfly Knife's icon originally used the one from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive . The Night's Edge and The Darkheart were temporarily added to the daily shop on April 20, 2022. The Frog melee can be obtained via purchasing the Froggy UGC accessory from the Avatar Shop . The Golden Rings melee from the Winter Update overwrites whatever kill effect the user had equipped with Gold, the effect used by the golden weapons.

Swinging this weapon with M1 will instantaneously kill a bystander, and throwing this weapon with M2 will allow it to be used at a longer range. Thrown knives will be recovered after 2 seconds, and during that time the Murderer is unable to use it. It is gained by the Murderer 10 seconds after the start of a round. When held, pressing E while looking at a dead body with at least 1 loot will allow you to take the appearance of it and make the body disappear. When a player is killed, 15 seconds are added to the round timer in every gamemode except Cold Killer and Murder Madness. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Instantly kills a player upon a hit. Can be thrown for a ranged attack. Cons: Very close ranged without throwing. Thrown knives take a few seconds to get back. Evil Presence [ ] If the Murderer has not killed anyone for 90 seconds, they will be notified that their Evil Presence is showing. During this time, their vision goes grayscale, and all other players will have their locations revealed to the murderer. They also turn completely black with glowing red eyes, and they emit a black smoke. If they kill someone, their Evil Presence will stop and everything will appear normal again. The Evil Presence can also be conditionally applied to players, usually in other gamemodes. Some conditions that can cause it are... Being infected in Infected. Having the revolver in Hot Potato. Being the Juggernaut or Freezer in Juggernaut and Cold Killer. Evil Presence can not show in Murderer Madness.

Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio (Outdated) 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The Kolibri is the smallest weapon in Arsenal . It is a three-shot kill to both the body and the head. It also has perfect accuracy due to not having spread, meaning whenever the crosshair is pointed, the Kolibri will guarantee hit it. It also has no fall-off, making it exceptional at long range compared to other pistols. However, the main drawbacks of the Kolibri is its small magazine size; having to not pair well with its insanely-fast fire-rate, which can expend its ammo in mere seconds. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Has no spread and recoil. Fast fire rate. Perfect accuracy. Fast pullout time. Cons: Small magazine capacity. Magazine is expended within seconds due to its fire rate. Tips [ ] The Kolibri's 7 shots can be used up quickly, so make sure not to fire them all at once. If you space out your shots, you'll be more likely to get a kill with this weapon with the first magazine. Three good shots from any range will kill from any distance since the Kolibri does not have ramp-up or fall-off damage. Gallery [ ] Kolibri in real life. Trivia [ ] The Kolibri was marketed and designed by an Austrian watchmaker named Franz Pfannl and advertised as a ladies self-defense weapon able to easily fit inside a handbag, despite the cartridge's inherent weakness. Only about 1,000 copies of the Kolibri were produced in real life. The Kolibri in-game is much stronger than its real life counterpart. The Kolibri's bullet itself is incredibly weak, with literature at the time suggesting the round was capable of penetrating only 10–40 millimeters (0.39–1.57 in) of a wooden pine board. The bullet wasn't even strong enough to penetrate a leather jacket. The real life Kolibri's bullet actually carries less energy than an average punch. In real life, the Kolibri lacks bore rifling, which makes it extremely inaccurate. Due to its extremely small size, the Kolibri would be very difficult to reload. Kolibri in German means hummingbird, the world's smallest bird, as a testament to the weapon's minuscule size. When on any mobile device, the Kolibri's firing mode changes to full automatic. Due to its small size, the Kolibri clips through viewmodel characters that have cosmetics on their hands. It is the signature weapon of Surfer skin .

In comparison to its brethren, the L86 boasts a longer barrel, the addition of a bipod, and a prominent rear vertical grip. In-game Information [ ] While an accurate weapon to roll, its damage and fire rate are quite low. The L86A3 is best used at longer ranges, where it can outgun most of its opponents. However, it falters in close engagements where those with faster weapons will easily outperform the L86. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Low ammo consumption rate. Moderate magazine size. Good maximum damage. Low spread - making it usable at long ranges. Cons: Low minimum damage. Slow rate of fire. Long reload time. High recoil Gallery [ ] Development of the weapon. L86A3 in real life with bipod. Trivia [ ] L86A3, along with the current version of FAMAS , were revealed on Twitter on September 8th, 2019. The L86A3 LSW is the squad automatic weapon part of the SA80 family. It is also fictionally designated as the A3, because the L86 line only went up to A2. The gun's rear vertical grip is for the user (lying prone) to have better control of the gun while the bipod is deployed. The earlier predecessors and variants of the L86A3 proved to be so unreliable that sometimes during firing, the gun would fall apart. The L86A3 is one of the 4 bullpup weapons in the game along with the AUG , the Dual Shotguns , and the FAMAS .

The Laser Rifle performs similarly to the Pulse Laser , except for the reloading time which is faster than the Pulse Laser's reloading time. The Laser Rifle has no spread which helps for long-range combat, This weapon has an extremely fast fire rate which helps defeating enemies quickly, and a high magazine size to prevent frequent reloads from happening too often. However, there are downsides such as low damage per shot, which makes killing opponents harder to do, and even with the high magazine size, the magazine size will expend fast due to its fire rate. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Very fast fire rate. Has no spread and recoil. Above-average magazine size for its class. Can kill enemies quickly if well aimed. Cons: High ammo consumption rate. Moderately slow reload. Tracer shot can give away the user's position. Can cause lag when spammed due to Tracer Shot. Low damage per shot. Slower movement speed for its class. Magazine size is easily expended due to its fire rate. Tips [ ] The Laser Rifle is very deadly, as it fires very quickly and accurately. However, its low damage and slow reload will make you a sitting duck if you miss your shots. The Laser Rifle's reload speed is 2.5 seconds, too slow to let you reload in an intense fight without dying. You may be able to kill opponents fast, but missing a few shots won't secure you the kill. It's especially important to keep your aim steady with the Laser Rifle. Stay at mid-range as much as possible, as this is your most advantageous distance against opponents. The Laser Rifle can potentially snipe someone from long-range, you're more likely to miss if you don't keep your aim constant on your target. At close-range it's even worse, as you'll have to track your opponent if they start hopping around you, which will waste a huge amount of ammo. At mid-range, you can easily aim at your target without moving your aim too much. The Laser Rifle has the most noticeable tracer shots in the game, so beware of any players using them to find your location. Gallery [ ] Sketch. Stage one development. Stage two. Stage three.

Trivia [ ] The Laser Rifle was revealed in the Arsenal Discord during the Summer Update II development on June 4th, 2020. The Laser Rifle was originally the Pulse Laser's name. It is the signature weapon of the Robo Sorcerer. This, the Focus, the Pulse Laser, the Railgun, the Plasma Launcher, and the Sunflower Sun has a unique equipping sound. The Laser Rifle makes an appearance in the RPG Event as the weapon used by the Commander Unit enemy.

It made its debut in the middle of the \"American Frontier\" (or \"Wild West\") era in 1887. While no longer produced since 1901 (due to the invention of more effective firearms), its popularity made its way into multiple media, such as western-themed films and video games. It functions differently compared to other existing Shotguns. After a shot, the user has to push out the lever, located at the bottom, to eject the shell and then pull the lever back to cock in a new one. When reloading, the user has to hold the lever open and use their free hand to load shells into the chamber located at the top of the weapon's handle. There is an option to flip this weapon by putting two fingers in the lever to spin it, but given the size, weight, and time to do so, it's highly impractical in a fight. In-game Information [ ] At first glance, the Lever Shotgun in-game seems lacking in performance, with a slow fire-rate. However, it holds the unique and very useful ability to be able to double jump by simply jumping in midair. When double jumping, sound will play as well as a puff of white smoke. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Double jump allows better mobility. One-shot kill to the body at close ranges. 1-by-1 reloading allows topping off. Cons: Low minimum damage per pellet. Slow empty reload. Slow rate of fire. Tips [ ] The strategy for the Lever Shotgun is based on your movement. Once you master this, it will be easier to get kills even with the low damage and slow reload speed. This weapon's added ability to double-jump will help you get close to enemies to ramp-up damage, and help you escape enemies while reloding. As with every Shotgun-class weapon, the Lever Shotgun especially needs to be shot while at close-range to enemies due to its low damage making it nearly useless at mid-range. Even with its weak power, it will only take a maximum of two shots (or one headshot) to get a kill. It is a lot easier than what the stats say. If you're coming to Arsenal as a Typical Colors 2 player, play with the Lever Shotgun as usual, but you must adjust your strategy a little: An Arsenal player's speed is similar to the Flanker in Typical Colors 2, so using the Lever Shotgun should be familiar. Compared to the Typical Colors 2 version, the Lever Shotgun in Arsenal actually deals a lot more damage at a 47 max per pellet compared to 10.5. This will help you get some very easy kills compared to back in TC2. There's also the added bonus of crits on any headshots made, so take advantage of this. Remember that you only have 100 HP compared to 125 HP, so you will die very quickly if you get too reckless. Trivia [ ] This Lever-Action Shotgun model appears to be a sawn-off version of the Winchester Model 1887 , which is capable of firing either a 12 gauge or 10 gauge shell. The end of the reload animation may be a reference to the Terminator -style reload, where Arnold Schwarzenegger flips the shotgun in such a way that the lever is re-cocked and the gun able to be fired again. In reality, flipping the weapon without an enlarged lever loop is completely impractical and would likely result in one's fingers being broken. The shotgun is also mostly flipped backwards. This, the Spencer Carbine , the Henry Rifle , the Golden Knife , the Ice Stars , the Ghostwalker and the Illumina are the only weapons in the game that have the double jump ability. The model of the Lever Shotgun as well as its animations came from Typical Colors 2 and is the primary weapon of the Flanker class, albeit with a different viewmodel angle, while retaining the old shooting sound effect. This weapon's ability to double jump is also a reference to the Flanker, as he has the natural ability to double-jump in his game.

It fires a bolt of lightning from its barrel which causes a hit registration-based weapon. It performs similarly to the Concussion Rifle and has aspects of the R800 . Like the Concussion Rifle, it has a rocket jump ability and it will launch players far away, potentially leading them to hazards. The Lightning Cannon fires slower than the R800 but can be constantly fired by holding down the left mouse button. It has 10 rounds in each magazine, reserve ammo of 20, and has no spread. However, the Lightning Cannon has drawbacks, such as a lack of a headshot multiplier and the slow rate of fire as stated before. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Large magazine capacity. High damage. Splash damage allows damaging multiple enemies with one hit. Can Rocket jump with little damage done to self. Cons: Slow fire rate. No headshot multiplier. High knockback lowers chance to land a consecutive hit. Players can kill themselves if not careful. Somewhat small explosion range. Gallery [ ] Stage one development Stage two. Stage three. Weapon render. Early view for the Lightning Cannon. Trivia [ ] The model of the Lightning Cannon was created back and was revealed in the Arsenal Discord server on December 24, 2019. It was never confirmed to be in the game, but it was made into the update. The Lightning Cannon and the Concussion Rifle are the only non-projectile weapons that players can rocket jump with. The weapon design seems to be inspired by the Volt Caster weapon from Anthem or the Lectro Shock Rifle weapon from Fortnite .

The model of this weapon is made of metal letters that spell out the word \"gun\" twice. One is used for the grip, while the second is used for the barrel of the gun. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] Literal Gun's damage is around 810 damage (headshots are 1125-1687 damage), meaning that enemies will be instantly killed in one-shot and its fast reload means going back to battle won't be a big deal. However, due to drawbacks, the Literal Gun suffers from a slow rate of fire, making a miss of a shot punishable along with the low magazine capacity. The high spread may be an issue, although the low rate of fire helps with tap-firing. Before it was changed to where it is now, the previous Literal Gun's model was the same, but it used a Hi-Power 's sound, held a capacity of 13, and its damage was around 45. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: One-shot kill at all ranges. Fast reload, as shared with the pistols of the game. Cons: Slow rate of fire. Small magazine and ammo capacities. High spread upon continuous shots. Tips [ ] Try to shoot the Literal Gun from long-range, as its first shot is 100% accurate. Its other two shots are very inaccurate, so make the first shot count. The other two shots can still be used at close- or mid-range, especially during intense fights. It should be very easy to get a kill with this gun due to its ridiculous power. However , beware that you only have 2 reloads before you can no longer use this weapon. In case this happens, keep an eye out for ammo boxes dropped by dead players, as one will give you back three shots. The Literal Gun is ridiculously powerful when fighting against the Hackula boss, especially since headshots deplete a good chunk of his HP. However, the chances of obtaining this weapon during the boss fight is extremely rare. Gallery [ ] Development of the weapon. With a custom bullet. Trivia [ ] The Literal Gun was revealed in the Arsenal Discord on April Fools 2020. The Literal Gun currently holds the record of having the highest damage in the game, with the Musket and the Pulse Musket coming second, the Tavor coming third, and the Barrett being fourth. The Literal Gun is the only weapon that can do over 1000 damage per shot. This, along with the Origami Gun , the Pocket Potassium , the Very Long Bat , the TP Launcher , the Dispenser and the Potassium Power are considered \"joke weapons\". Originally the Literal Gun had similar stats to the Hi-Power however it was later buffed heavily. It also originally had the same firing sound as the Hi-Power, but it was changed to a comedic \"Pew\" sound effect. The letter \"n\" from the \"gun\" word that acts as the barrel, is actually interlocked with the lower hole of the letter \"g\" in the \"gun\" word that acts as the grip. The model of the Literal Gun was created and was revealed in the Arsenal Discord server on May 31st, 2020. It has a similar knife version of it called the Literal Melee. It is the signature weapon of Tomfoolery Delinquent skin. The font used for the creation of the Literal Gun is the \"Gill Sans\" font.

It is considered as the first double action only semi-automatic pistol, produced until 1925 and 45,000 were made. Its strange feature was the top-loading magazine which could be inserted and released from the top. Contents 1 In-game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Gallery 4 Trivia 5 Audio (Outdated) 6 Weapon History In-game Information [ ] The Little Tom has no spread at all making it suited for any range. This gun destroys enemies if players can aim as it works somewhat like a low damage and low ammo machine gun. However, it has a major difference in fire rate and ammo capacity, trading 9 rounds for automatic-firing capabilities and less damage. This removes the ability to kill an enemy with 4 shots. This gun can shred enemies, but players need to watch out for the ammo. With only 9 rounds, the magazine empties out faster than people might first think. The gun is automatic after all, so reloading can happen quite often if the player continues to miss with this weapon. It can take about half the magazine to kill an enemy. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Fast rate of fire. Decent reload time. No spread and recoil. Cons: Low 9-round magazine capacity. Magazine is easily expended due to its fire rate. Gallery [ ] Little Tom in real life. Trivia [ ] The Little Tom is the first and only double-action semi-automatic handgun to be ever created. The Little Tom fires a .32 ACP which is comparable to 9mm. The Little Tom reuses the previous G-17's firing sound. The Little Tom is one of the automatic pistols along with the G-18 , the TEC-9 , the Electric Revolver , and the Falkor .

The P08 model is generally recognized as the \"face\" of the Luger pistol models, for its use by Germany during World War I and II (though in WWII, it was supplanted by the Walther P38). Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The weapon performs very similarly to the Handcannon pistol. The Luger P08 trades lower overall damage for faster firerate. When using this weapon, headshots can instantly kill an enemy. Despite the reduced headshot damage, it can still one shot an enemy, therefore, with the faster firerate, it is more efficient than the Handcannon, provided all shots are headshots. However, because of drawbacks; this weapon does have a major downside to it, which is its body damage. With only 22 damage to the body, it will take five hits for a kill, which is very inconvenient as the gun only has 8 rounds in its magazine. Not only that, but despite the Luger having a fast rate of fire, it is capped, so it will take time to land those five shots, giving the enemy plenty of time to kill the user. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Headshots insta-kill Deals fair body damage. No spread and recoil. Perfect accuracy. Quick reload. Decent Firerate Cons: Small 8-round magazine. Tips [ ] The Luger is an underrated monster at intense fights. It takes 2 shots to kill at close-range, and its perfect accuracy allows you to land an easy headshot kill from a distance. The Luger also reloads slightly faster than the other Pistols in the game. Because of the Luger's low magazine size, space out your shots . This will prevent you from wasting ammo and reloading. An alternate strategy is to headshot-snipe opponents from long-range. This will be easier if you crouch down, as it will slow your movement and make it harder to be fired back at. Do beware that bodyshots will heavily punish you, so this strategy comes with risk. Only do this if you have no better options. You can hit an opponent and deal enough damage for a teammate to finish them off and give you an assist. Gallery [ ] Luger in real life. Trivia [ ] The Luger is a German toggle-locked semi-automatic pistol that uses a jointed arm to lock and was developed by Georg Luger as an improved version of the C-93 Borchardt and is most notable for its use by Germany during WWI and WWII. The Luger can fire either a 7.62x21mm or a 9x19mm Parabellum cartridge. During both World War I and II, Allied soldiers often captured Lugers as trophies/prizes from German soldiers. The grip of the P08 has a place where it can attach a carbine stock. There is a carbine version of the P08 called Model 1902 Carbine, with an extended barrel and a carbine stock attached, the weapon is also normally used with a 30-round snail drum mag. The Luger uses the same reload sound as the G-19X , the G-21 , and the G-18 , albeit with a lower pitch.

In-game Information [ ] The M1 Garand is one of the semi-automatic weapons in-game, and as such, players must wait for a brief delay before firing the weapon again. However, the M1 Garand does have a good damage range, being one of the few semi-automatic rifles to instant kill to the body at closer ranges. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Fast empty reload. Decent rate of fire. Cons: Low 8-round magazine capacity. High spread upon continuous shots. Tips [ ] The M1 Garand might be a bit more difficult to get a kill with due to its lower accuracy, as its spread gets higher more quickly compared to the other Marksman Rifles. While the M1 Garand is still somewhat effective at mid-range, it is actually easier to fight at close-ranges as well. Its maximum ramp-up is 110 damage, which will secure a kill. It is not recommended to shoot from long-range, unless a carefully placed shot is made. Trivia [ ] Although the weapon is often pronounced \"Ga-rand\", John Garand, the weapon's designer, apparently preferred the pronunciation that would rhyme with errand , being \"Ger-rend\". The Garand's distinctive ping comes from the ejection of an empty 8-round En Bloc clip, of which the M1 Garand used. It is said that Axis forces in WWII used this ping to alert themselves to an empty rifle, although the usefulness of this noise was likely very low with multiple enemies and deafening gunfire often preventing the hearing of such sound in the first place. It is also said the Allies spoofed the sound to lure Axis soldiers to their doom. The M1 Garand came from Unit 1968 and was modeled by Ben. In popular culture, particularly video games, the M1 Garand is depicted as impossible to reload until all 8 shots are fired. This is a common misconception, as the M1 Garand features a clip-release button on the left side of the receiver. This most likely originated from Allied soldiers being instructed to not bother with reloading mid-clip. To reload an M1 mid-clip, the user must first press the clip release button with their supporting hand, then pull back on the charging handle. Reloading then continues as if the rifle were empty. \"Garand Thumb\" is a painful occurrence when the M1 user tries to load an en-bloc clip into the gun, the user's thumb would get slammed into the metal receiver due to a pre-mature release of the bolt or the user's ineptitude with reloading the weapon. The M1 Garand and the Springfield Rifle are the only weapons that have a faster empty reload time. Gallery [ ] M1 Garand in real life.

Initially designed as a direct counterpart to the AK-47 series of rifles, a trial version, the T44, fed off a specialized round. However, the U.S. Ordnance Group objected, wanting the rifle to feed off the 7.62x51 NATO round. Several more modifications for standardized-features resulted in a rather bulky rifle. The M14 would serve as a long-range, hard-hitter. It was used partially through the Vietnam War before being replaced by the M16A1 assault rifle. Current Archived In Arsenal , the M14 is a rifle that shows its power. Its high damage, such as a one-shot kill upon a headshot at all ranges and a minimum three-shot ensures enemies will get suffered. Its fast rate of fire means shredding enemies at close range is an easy task. However, the M14 has a high spread penalty, more noticeably seen than other semi-autos. Spamming the M14 results in the weapon being unusable at longer ranges, even though aiming for the head somewhat makes up for the high spread penalty. The M14 was different in the Archived by a noticeable change. Unlike the current version, the M14 didn't have almost any spread at all. However, the damage and the rate of fire remained the same. This made it very powerful and even compared to that of Mossberg 500 we have in the modern version. However, this was later nerfed to the current M14 in-game. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Highest magazine capacity out of all semi-automatic rifles. Fairly quick reload. Fast rate of fire. Cons: High spread upon continuous shots. Slow movement speed. Tips [ ] Take advantage of the M14's ability to shoot from mid-range. This way, you can easily beat any enemy who has a Shotgun-class weapon. Unless the enemy is close to you, space out your shots to prevent the M14 from having high spread. Don't pick spots that are too high to shoot from. The M14 may be somewhat accurate, but it is not Sniper Rifle-classed. Gallery [ ] A red Solid Color M14 in BETA Arsenal . M14 in real life. Archived M14 in real life. Trivia [ ] While the M14 is portrayed as a semi-automatic weapon in-game, in reality, it is select-fire, meaning it can fire in either semi-auto or automatic. However most M14s portrayed are semi - auto. Although the M14 being replaced by the M16 , some soldiers still use the M14 today, although rare. The M14 has a variant called the M1A , which is the civilian market and is only semi-automatic. The M14 EBR is the more modern version of the M14. The M14's firing sound is the same as the old M14 firing sound in Unit 1968 , a Vietnam War ROLVe game. This weapon was used for Trooper's secondary weapon, the Boonie Blaster in Typical Colors 2 . The damage is very similar to the SKS that was added to Arsenal.

It is a variant of the M14 battle rifle and was originally built for use with units of United States Special Operations Command, such as the United States Navy SEALs, Delta Force, and task specific Green Berets ODA teams/units. These weapons are made for both the designated marksman and the close combat roles. Since 2010, the U.S. Army has assigned two M14 EBR-RI rifles per infantry platoon for units deploying to Afghanistan. The M14 EBR-RI has a standard weight 22.0-inch (560 mm) barrel and lugged GI flash hider; it is not to be confused with the Mk 14 Mod 0 or Mod 1. In-game information [ ] It has a rather high headshot damage, making this a more power-based weapon. It has a slow fire rate, albeit still quick compared to weapons such as the Grease Gun . The MK14 EBR also does less damage compared to its normal counterpart, the M14 . Similar to the MK18 , the EBR uses an EoTech sight that you can access by pressing RMB or LT on Xbox, reducing recoil and firing more accurately. This can also be a sniper rifle if you have to aim for the person themselves instead of just the head. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Accessible sight by pressing the right mouse button. Moderate magazine size. Fast fire rate Decent reload time Cons: High recoil. Somewhat high spread upon hip firing. Sluggish movement speed. Gallery [ ] ADS M14 EBR in real life. Trivia [ ] The M14 EBR is more formally known as the Mk 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle and is a modernized, compacted variant of the M14 battle rifle, originally requested to be developed by the Navy SEALs . While the gun is select-fire, it is more commonly used as a designated marksman rifle. If you use ADS, pull out your melee without removing the ADS and pull out this weapon, you will get a lot less spread and recoil. while not having the ADS, although, the only cons of doing this is that you will have no crosshair, but using a custom crosshair will make this weapon very Overpowered. The M14 EBR is one of the weapons that has access to ADS.

The gun received praise for its killing power, lightweight, and accuracy. However, it was infamous for jamming at the most inconvenient circumstances. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Trivia 4 Audio 5 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The M16A1 is an automatic weapon , firing 5.56mm rounds from a small 20-round magazine. The weapon's damage ranges from 18-34, 18-30 from a body-shot and 23-34 on a headshot. The M16A1's low magazine size can expend the ammo quickly, although the weapon's remarkably low spread penalty and mediocre damage should allow you a kill within a single magazine. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Decent damage at close quarters. Very fast rate of fire. Tight spread. Decent Reload. Cons: High ammo consumption rate. Small magazine size. Low minimum body damage. Trivia [ ] The M16A1 is the production model of the XM16E1 , the second variant of the first M16 rifle. It was deployed to US troops during the Vietnam war, used to replace the aging M14 . The M16A1 is the signature weapon of the Beret, Corporal, Cthulhu, Cyber Mercenary, Deserted Beret, Grunt, Operative, and Secret Agent skins. It was also formerly a signature weapon of Paintballer. This was changed to the Mossberg 500 , and then to the Paintball Gun . It was also formerly the signature weapon of the Magician. This was changed to the Spellbook in the Summer Update II . The firing mode of M16A1 was originally burst fire in Arsenal Archived . The previous in-game M16A1 is modeled after an older version of the rifle, the XM16E1, which has a 3-prong flash hider like the in-game model. The old model of the M16A1 was taken from Unit 1968 , a ROLVe game set in Vietnam. The previous model can still be seen as a worldmodel.

Differences from the prior A1 variant were mostly to improve reliability and performance, and it also marks the transition from a triangular style of handguard to the cylindrical one. The M16A2 featured in Arsenal has an attatchment: a grenade launcher named the M203. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Trivia 5 Gallery 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] M16A2 M203 The rifle contains 30 rounds per magazine, along with 90 rounds of reserve ammunition. Every time you fire with the weapon, it will fire 3 rounds out, each dealing 28 or 48 damage on body shot or headshot respectively. It's best used whenever the grenade launcher misses its shot or you're in close range. It is also more effective than the grenade launcher at longer ranges. The main reason the M16A2 is considered powerful, however, is the addition of the M203 grenade launcher, which can be accessed with the RMB. This explosive projectile weapon comes with one round already in the tube, and one for reserve. The grenade fires in an arch, so hitting targets at longer ranges requires aiming higher to land the grenade near or on the target. Upon hitting or splashing next to an enemy, the grenade will do 112-150 damage. Multiple kills are possible if multiple enemies are clustered together. However, it takes around 3 seconds to reload after firing the M203. The grenade also travels slowly compared to normal bullets. This, coupled with the grenade's quirky arch, makes the grenade launcher less effective at longer ranges. The Grenades also needs to be used wisely, as they cannot be refilled with ammo packs. Players can also rocket jump with it, like the M79 . However, precision is required because of the way that the grenade's splash damage works. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] M16A2 M203 Pros: One-hit kill when firing 3-round burst at close quarters. Fast fire rate when bursting. High damage. Decent reload time Moderate magazine size Cons: Somewhat long burst delay in between bursts. Slow movement speed Pros: One-hit kill on contact and splash. Explosive area-of-effect capability allows for multi-kills with one grenade. Faster projectile speed than most explosive-launching weapons. Fast reload time for an explosive weapon. Rocket jump ability. Cons: Arching projectile makes it harder to hit enemies from long range. Users can instantly kill themselves if not careful. Only 1 grenade in the tube and reserve. Small area-of-effect range. Grenade cannot be refilled by ammo packs. Users can throw themselves out of the map if not careful. Tips [ ] The M16A2 is a very versatile weapon, as it is a burst rifle and has a grenade launcher (the M203). This means that you can shoot bullets or explosives, depending on the situation of the current battle. Remember to right-click (or tap the assigned button on mobile) to switch between bullets and grenades. Note that there's a 1-second delay between switching ammo and starting to shoot. Split-second timing is an infamous element in Arsenal , so don't switch ammo during an intense fight. The best strategy for the M16A2 is to use the M203's grenades to get a kill, and save the M16A2's bullets for when you run out. The M203's grenades are much more powerful than the M16A2's bullets. They deal enough damage to insta-kill opponents. However , the size of its explosion is smaller than other explosives. You'll have to carefully take aim to secure a kill. Since there's only two grenades, you can use one to do a rocket-jump and land on a higher platform. Then, you can use the remaining grenade to get a kill while aiming from above. Keep an eye out for ammo boxes on the ground to give yourself more grenades. One ammo box gives you one grenade. The M16A2's bullets have decent range, however they deal minimal damage at longer distances. The best time to use the bullets are when an enemy is close to you, as you can quicklly put them away in under three burst-shots. This is crucial, as using a M203 grenade in this situation would result in a self-death, or even a demotion Trivia [ ] The M16A2 is a part of a long line of American rifles dubbed the M16s . It is the successor to the M16A1 and the XM16E1 , made after combat experience in Vietnam proved both guns to be deadly to its user, adding extensive modifications to the weapon overall. The grenade launcher under the M16A2 is the M203 GL, a single shot 40mm launcher designed to be attached under a rifle, meant to replace the older M79 grenade launcher. The M16A2's grenade launcher is the only weapon with ammo in the game that does not auto-reload if the setting is turned on. The M16A2's grenade launcher is the only weapon that can launch enemies without providing a self-damage reduction when jumping. The M16A2 has the resemblance of the weapon used in the film \" Scarface \" (1983) that the protagonist \"Tony Montana\" used at the end of the film. M16A2 is the only other 3-round burst weapon in the game along with the Plasma Launcher . The M16A2 was seen in the BOGO badge icon, hinting that it can allow for multiple kills. This weapon used to be the signature weapon of the Paintballer. However this was changed. The M203 along with the Golden Gun , the RPG , the Bow , the M79 , the Pocket Potassium , the Musket and Golden Musket are the only weapons that hold a single round.= Initially, the grenade was team colored. In the Adopt Me trailer, the Delinquent skin was seen holding the M16A2, but in the trailer, the M16A2 is fully automatic instead of burst fire. This, the Spellbook and the Tavor are the only weapons in the game that have a mode switch ability. The M203's previous firing sound was taken from Killing Floor 2 . The previous model can still be seen as a worldmodel. Gallery [ ] Current M203 activation. Previous M203 activation. The M16A2 and M203 in the Arsenal trailer. The M16A2 and the M203 in real life.

It served as the standard issue sidearm to the US Armed forces from 1911 to 1986 and served in wars, such as World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The M1911 was replaced by the M9 Beretta for the standard-issue US army sidearm in October 1986, but due to its popularity, modern versions of it are still being used in some units of the US special forces and Navy. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio (Outdated) 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] In-game, players can expect a high recoil firearm with a preference for shorter ranges, due to the weapon's high spread penalty upon firing in rapid succession. This high spread penalty is one of the main problems with this weapon; the other is the magazine size. However, tap-firing the M1911 can mitigate both of these issues. Players should note the weapon's nearly uncapped semi-automatic rate of fire, as the M1911 can be rapidly fired by those capable of doing so. Luckily, the weapon shares a fast reload time with the majority of the pistols in Arsenal . This can be paired with the weapon's high headshot damage of 96 at point-blank, allowing players to easily kill enemies with two shots. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Quick reload. Fast rate of fire. Cons: High spread and recoil upon continuous shots. Small magazine size. The magazine is easily expended due its fast fire-rate. Tips [ ] The M1911 is pretty effective at mid-range when shooting while approaching an opponent to get damage in before they start fighting back. Do mind that the high spread only allows the first 4 shots of your magazine to land, so don't stay at mid-range for too long. Two headshots from mid-range will also do the trick. The M1911 only takes two shots at close-range to kill. However, a headshot while near your target will instantly kill them. Its fast reload speed makes it good for intense fights. There's no harm in using all of your shots in one go. But you can still stop for a second to reset the spread. Gallery [ ] M1911 in third person. M1911 in real life. Previous M1911 in real life. Trivia [ ] The weapon designer, John Browning, was the same person who developed the M2 Browning, Hi-Power , Trench Gun , BAR , and many others. The M1911, formalized designated the \"United States Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911\" by the USAF , is a semi-automatic single-action pistol utilizing the .45 ACP cartridge. It served as the USAF's standard sidearm from its adoption in 1911, until 1986, before being replaced by the Beretta M9 . The M1911's previous mesh is from another ROLVe game, Unit 1968 . The previous firing sound uses the old firing sound of the M1911 in Unit 1968 . It is the signature weapon of the Contractor, and the Heister skins . The M1911 older model was originally used for Flanker's secondary weapon, the Winger in Typical Colors 2 . The previous version found in Arsenal was modelled after the blank-firing Bruni 96 M1911, due to its lack of details. The M1911 was the most popular pistol in 1990s, before being taken over by the M9 and eventually the Glock family.

It was a six-shooter used by the US military and manufactured by the American companies, Colt and Smith &amp; Wesson . In-game Information [ ] This was the first revolver in the game, but it was removed in the mega update. It functions most similar to the Windicator having similar 37 damage, fast reload, somewhat decent headshot damage, but unlike the Windicator, it has way less recoil and spread, making it much better for longer ranges. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Low spread. Quick reload. Cons: Low damage for a revolver. Small magazine. Trivia [ ] The M1917 is incorrectly modeled after either the Colt Python or SW Model 629 revolver rather than an M1917 revolver. The M1917 is predecessor of the Peacemaker , Peppergun , Webley , Windicator , Electric Revolver , Python , Dual LCRs and the Pathbringer .

The M1919 saw service as a light infantry, coaxial, mounted, aircraft, and anti-aircraft machine gun by the U.S. and many other countries. In-game Information [ ] The M1919A6 Machine Gun boasts powerful bullet power; a one-shot kill up close, a two-shot kill to the head at longer ranges, and a minimum three-shot kill. The magazine size is also high, being at 100. However, since the M1919A6 has high damage, it trades for a high spread penalty, forcing users to go closer to hit most of their bullets. It also trades for long reload time. However, the high damage maintains the effectiveness of the weapon at long-range not as bad. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Large magazine size. Fast rate of fire. Cons: High spread penalty upon continuous fire. Sluggish movement speed. Grueling reload time. High magazine consumption rate. Tips [ ] The M1919A6 Machine Gun has extremely high spread when fired. In fact, it's the most inaccurate Machine Gun in the entire game. The M1919A6 Machine Gun is most effective at close-range. Firing from mid-range (and of course, long-range) will have to depend on luck, and therefore a waste of time and effort . You can close the distance between you and your target by equipping your Knife , then switching back to the M1919A6 Machine Gun. If firing from mid-range, try firing only around 5 bullets a time, then stopping for a second to reset the spread. Believe it or not, you can accidentally get a headshot from a random bullet when shooting this weapon if you get lucky. Its incredibly slow reload time makes the M1919A6 Machine Gun a \"one-and-done\" weapon, as it prompts players to get a kill within the first clip, or face the consequences. If you don't want to wait out the slow reload, resorting to getting a backstab with your Knife can be an alternate solution. Trivia [ ] When it was first released, the M1919A6 Machine Gun appears to be held incorrectly in view model. The M1919A6 was an air-cooled development of the standard US machine gun of World War I, the John M. Browning-designed water-cooled M1917. In real life, when the gun was ready to fire, a round would be in the chamber and the bolt and barrel group would be locked together, with the locking block at the rear of the bolt. When the rear of the trigger was pivoted upwards by the operator, the front of the trigger tipped downward, pulling the sear out of engagement with the spring-loaded firing pin, allowing it to move forward and strike the primer of the cartridge. The M1919A6 has the second-fastest reload in the machine gun class behind the DB Chauchat . The M1919A6 Machine Gun's firing sounds were taken from Unit 1968: Vietnam . The M1919A6 animations were taken from Unit 1968: Vietnam . When held, the player moves at 12.3 studs per second, slower than any other gun.

In-game Information [ ] The M1A1 Carbine is a semi-automatic rifle that packs a punch. Its powerful damage, such as an instant kill upon a headshot, a two-shot kill upon a body shot at close range, and a minimum three-shot kill. The fast rate of fire allows quicker killing speed to enemies, meaning that players will be killed in a matter of seconds at close range. Because of the rule of drawbacks, just like other semi-auto rifles, the M1A1 Carbine suffers a high spread penalty upon spamming. However, the spread starts to increase upon the third shot, but will quickly recover to both high precision and accuracy. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Fast rate of fire. Large magazine size. Fairly fast reload. Cons: Somewhat slow movement speed. High spread upon continuous shots. Tips [ ] The M1A1 Carbine is one of the easier Marksman Rifles to get a kill with, due to its ability to effectively deal damage from any distance. A headshot from long-range or spamming shots at close-range will guarantee you a kill. Even with its big magazine size, make sure not shoot all the bullets at once. If you see that they are not hitting your target(s), it's best to stop and wait for a second for the spread to reset. If your opponents have not noticed you, you can use the time to quickly reload. Trivia [ ] The M1A1 Carbine was created because Germany's use of glider-borne and paratrooper forces to launch surprise ‘Blitzkrieg’ attacks behind the front lines generated a request for a new compact infantry weapon for support troops and paratroopers alike. The rifle originated as a design by Jonathan \"Ed\" Browning, brother of the famous firearm designer John Browning. The M1A1 was used from WWII and far into the Vietnam War and was widely used by military, police, and civilian forces around the world after that. The M1 Carbine is incorrectly named the M1A1 Carbine . The difference is the M1 is the fixed stock, but the M1A1 is the variant with the folding metal stock. The M1A1 also has a select-fire variant called the M2 carbine , capable of firing in full-automatic. The M3 Carbine was another variant that is select-fire and has an infrared scope, however most M3 IRs were semi - auto only. The M1A1 Carbine is the most produced American Rifle in WWII. Strangely, the M1A1 Carbine can do a one-shot kill potential on the body at close range despite the max body damage being at a 99. The M1A1 Carbine is often noted to be very similar to the M1A1 Paratrooper, albeit the Paratrooper having faster movement speed, lower accuracy, and a slightly lower-pitched firing sound. While the M1A1 Carbine in Arsenal has a fixed wooden buttstock, in reality, the M1A1 variant was mainly manufactured with the folding paratrooper stock. Despite this, the stocks on refurbished M1A1s were commonly swapped out in armories. The M1A1 Carbine was designed to replace a handgun instead of a rifle. The M1A1 Carbine's firing sound and reload sound effect was taken from the M1A1 carbine in Day of Infamy , only sped up. These effects were also used for the weapon in Unit 1968 , a previous ROLVE game. Gallery [ ] M1A1 Carbine in real life.

In-game Information [ ] The M1A1 Paratrooper acts somewhat similarly to its counterpart, the M1A1 Carbine but with two statistical differences: having faster movement speed at the cost of accuracy. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Fast rate of fire. Large magazine size. Fairly fast reload. Cons: High spread upon continuous shots. Tips [ ] The M1A1 Paratrooper is one of the easier Marksman Rifles to get a kill with, due to its ability to effectively deal damage from any distance. A headshot from long-range or spamming shots at close-range will guarantee you a kill. Even with its big magazine size, make sure not shoot all the bullets at once. If you see that they are not hitting your target(s), it's best to stop and wait for a second for the spread to reset. If your opponents have not noticed you, you can use the time to quickly reload. Trivia [ ] Despite being similar to the M1A1 Carbine, the M1A1 Paratrooper has a folding stock built-in. The folding stock was used to make the gun light and compact, making it suitable to carry in parachuting jumps, hence the name \"Paratrooper\". The M1A1 Paratrooper saw most of its usage throughout WWII, being favored by paratroopers for its lightweight and firepower, but its reputation on the battlefield deteriorated by its lack of penetration and stopping power. Strangely, just like the M1A1 Carbine, the M1A1 Paratrooper can do a one-shot kill potential on the body at close range despite the max body damage being at a 99. The metal frames of the folding stock usually broke earlier than the weapon itself. The M1A1 Paratrooper's firing sound and reload sound effect was taken from the M1A1 carbine in Day of Infamy , only sped up. Gallery [ ] M1A1 Paratrooper in real life.

It has been used in a variety of different wars. In-game Information [ ] The M249 has a fast rate of fire while being somewhat accurate for a machine gun. It also boasts some similar specs to the Negev , such as a high magazine capacity (albeit 50 rounds less), slow reload time and slow movement speed. However, the M249 has higher minimum damage and tighter spread, outperforming the Negev at longer ranges. Pros and Cons [ ] Pros: Very high ammo capacity of 100. Fast rate of fire. High damage at close ranges. Cons: Sluggish movement speed. Spread gets higher very quickly. Grueling reload time. Low minimum damage. Tips [ ] Just like some of the other Machine Guns, the M249's spread makes it not so viable at mid-range. More bullets will hit your targets if you get closer to them. Because holding this weapon makes you move slower, equipping your Knife can help you close the distance between you and your opponent quickly. If you cannot get close, you can attempt to fire shots by simply tapping (not holding) the fire button on your device. Just like every hitscan weapon in Arsenal , the M249's very first bullet is always 100% accurate. Its incredibly slow reload time makes the M249 a \"one-and-done\" weapon, as it prompts players to get a kill within the first clip, or face the consequences. If you don't want to wait out the slow reload, resorting to getting a backstab with your Knife can be an alternate solution. Trivia [ ] The weapon's return was sneak peeked in the Arsenal Discord on May 28, 2021. M249 was originally going to be added into the game during the development of Gun Game however it was left scrapped and later released to the archived phase of Arsenal . &#91; 1 &#93; This is an evolution of the Belgian weapon, the FN Minimi . A variant of the M249, the M249 SAW Para , features a collapsible stock and a shorter barrel. The current M249 model appears to be similar to the EM249 , but recolored, with regular bullets, and with a stock. The firing and reloading sound effects were taken from ROLVe's game, Typical Colors 2 .

They were built from standard Remington 700 rifles, with the addition of a scope and a few years into its service, the replacement of the wooden stock with a fiberglass one. While still in service with SOCOM today, it and several other sniper rifles (such as its successor, the MK 13 rifle) are currently being replaced by the Barrett MRAD sniper rifle. In-game Information [ ] Compared to the MS556 , the M40 fires one shot at a time from an ammo pool of 25, meaning that players will not need to reload, and only need to wait a brief period after every shot. On the other hand, the MS556 has no movement de-buffs, although it has a magazine size of 7, with an ammo pool of only 14, with the M40 being 25. The M40 has no spread and contains a scope, making aiming a crucial ability to have when using this weapon. Due to the extremely slow rate of fire, hitting 2 body-shots in order to kill an enemy will take too long, especially if the user is noticed by the enemy, so a headshot (or just a lot of time to land the body-shots) is almost required to advance. Missing with this weapon is extremely detrimental, so players should try their best to hit their shots. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Perfect accuracy. Scope allows for better magnification. No reloading required. Cons: Slow fire rate. Slow movement speed. Somewhat long pullout time. Tips [ ] The M40 is best at exclusively long-range compared to the other Sniper Rifles, as its mid-range combat ability is not as effective. If an enemy pounces on you while you are sniping, a quick shot to their body will deal 80 damage, which will hopefully be enough for a teammate to get an assist for you. If you're coming to Arsenal as a Typical Colors 2 player, the M40 is very different from the Sniper Rifle you are used to. In Arsenal , the M40's shots do flat hits for 80 damage along with insta-killing upon a headshot, instead of charging up its power the longer you're scoped in. Instead of waiting, it's a better idea to attempt quickscope shots instead. Shooting without scoping in is also an option, as you still will deal 80/240 damage if either scoped or unscoped. You also do not have a laser that gives your position away if you scope in, but instead only a tiny dot on wherever you are aiming. Use this to your advantage. Gallery [ ] M40 in real life. Trivia [ ] The M40 is the modified USMC ( United States Marine Corps ) variant of the Remington 700 , firing a 7.62x51mm round. The one in-game is the original version of the M40, using a one-piece wooden stock which also serves as the main weapon frame. The reason for the 25 round ammo pool and lack of reserves/reloading is that the character is loading a single round into the rifle after each and every shot, despite the M40 feeding from a 5-round internal magazine in real-life. The M40 itself also appeared in Typical Colors 2 as an old model of a primary weapon for Marksman (known as the Sniper Rifle ). The weapon model is also based on the Sniper Rifle from Team Fortress 2 , minus the charge (the mechanism in which the weapon deals more damage when scoped for longer) and slowed movement whilst scoped. This is the signature weapon of the Poke &amp; The Marksman skins .

It was first introduced in 1993 as an automatic version of the M4 series. In-game Information [ ] Current Alpha The M4A1 is quite the show, boasting similar statistics to the M16A1 , albeit coming with a larger magazine but with the cost of a higher spread penalty. The weapon's damage is 21 minimum, with a maximum of 48 upon a close-range headshot. Being quite the average automatic weapon, the M4A1 should prove to be easy to get a kill with. The weapon's high damage, magazine, and fire rate will make way for a player's kill. The M4A1 (simply known as Assault Rifle in Gun Game ) in the older versions is quite the same details and functions as the current version with the exception of the damage being low and it damages the player the same result (13). The M4A1 was later replaced by its suppressed version in mid-2016. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros Fast rate of fire. High damage. Moderate magazine size. Moderately accurate. Cons High spread upon continuous firing. Moderately slow reload time. Tips [ ] The M4A1 excels at intense fights. Its fast firing rate and damage can kill an opponent in under a second. This can only be guaranteed by good aim (obviously), as missed shots will force you to retreat and reload. Because of its high spread, stay within at least mid-range for more of your shots to land. If stuck at long-range, tap-fire instead of unleashing all of your bullets at once to land more shots. It kills very quickly at close-range because its damage is ramped up. Gallery [ ] The M4A1 in real life. Trivia [ ] The M4A1 Carbine is a shorter, lighter variant of the M16A2 , firing 5.56x45mm. The in-game version is supposed to be the M4A1, the fully automatic variant of the M4 carbine used by special operation units such as the Navy SEALs and the Rangers. The M4A1 Carbine can be seen in greater numbers than the M16 platform in military service, as it is both extensively used in the US Armed Forces and currently replacing the M16 rifles used by the USMC and US Army. The M4A1 firing sound is same as the current unsuppressed M4A1 from CS:GO . The M4A1 Carbine is the automatic variant of the 3-burst carbine; The M4 Carbine . The M4A1's in-game model is actually the Colt Model 723 carbine (as evident by the integral carry handle), which was a predecessor to the actual M4A1 (which has a detachable carry handle). This also applies to Nailgun . The M4A1's model was taken from Counter Blox . It is the signature weapon of GOC Present.

It was introduced in 1957 and has done duty in every branch of the U.S. military, along with that, some of the parts are based on the German MG42 , and was replaced/supplemented by the M249 machine gun. In-game Information [ ] Added in the Summer Update , the M60 is a powerful weapon with a large 150-round belt and another in reserve. While difficult to aim when spraying at longer ranges, players can easily utilize this weapon's relatively high damage to kill enemies. However, one major drawback of the M60 is its reload time; if a player manages to empty the entire magazine, they would face a long reload time, similar in length to the MG42. Due to its high spread penalty, it is recommended to use the M60 in closer ranges. This way, the M60 can easily hit more bullets, thereby doing more damage. Since the damage is already high, killing targets in close quarters combat should not be a problem. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros High damage. Very high ammo capacity of 150. Fast fire rate allows for very quick kills. Cons Sluggish movement speed. Grueling reload time. High spread penalty. Tips [ ] The M60 does have a spread penalty, but it's not as high as most of the other Machine Guns. In fact, it's similar to the M249 , but slightly more accurate. The M60 is most effective at close-range. However, in a few scenarios it's still viable at mid-range. Factors would include if your target is running from or to you, and how many objects are blocking your path. Using your Knife to run faster will help you close the distance between you and your target and fire at close-range. Tap-firing instead of holding down the fire button will make more bullets land from mid-range. Its incredibly slow reload time makes the M60 a \"one-and-done\" weapon, as it prompts players to get a kill within the first clip, or face the consequences. If you don't want to wait out the slow reload, resorting to getting a backstab with your Knife can be an alternate solution. Trivia [ ] With a belt capacity of 150, the M60 tied with the EM249 , the Flamethrower , and the Acid Spitter all have the highest ammo capacity out of any weapon in the game after the Minigun with the capacity of 800. The M60 was nicknamed \" The Pig \" during the Vietnam War, mainly due to its imposing silhouette, appetite for ammunition and bulky size. Still, soldiers appreciated its firepower and handling. The M60's old firing sound was the same as its incarnation in another ROLVe game, Unit 1968: Vietnam . The weight of an M60 in real life is 23.15 pounds (10.5 kg) due to its bulky size. The M60 is the signature weapon of Beard, Rambo Santa and used to be for the Rhino and Brute. After the Minigun was added back, the Brute's signature weapon switched back to the Minigun while the Rhino remains unchanged.

It was used by the US Military during the Vietnam War and fires a 40mm grenade round. In-game Information [ ] It works similar to that of the M16A2 's M203 grenade launcher but with more ammo and lower damage. The projectile is relatively quick, which allows for easier long-range hits, despite its projectile arch. It also works like the Rocket Launcher , with the splash damage and direct contact damage being the same. However, because it is a breech-loading weapon, it can only hold one grenade in the tube at a time. Players that miss a shot will suffer from a time-consuming reload. The M79 instantly kills on direct and splash contact. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: One-shot kill on direct and splash contact. Fast projectile speed. Explosive area-of-effect capability allows you for multiple kills. Ability to rocket jump . Large splash radius. Plenty of reserve ammo for if you miss. Cons: Users can easily kill themselves if not careful. Projectile arches make it harder to hit enemies at longer ranges. Carries only one round. Somewhat long reload. Somewhat slow load-out time. Gallery [ ] M79 in real life. Trivia [ ] The M79 uses a 40mm Grenade, just like the M16A2's M203. The M79 was used for the US Military during the Vietnam war. However, it was a stand-alone GL, meaning that it could take a long time to reload another gun and the M79 at the same time. So they thought of an idea to attach the grenade launcher to the rifle for the multi-purpose use, known as the M203 Grenade Launcher. The M79 received the nicknames of \" Thumper \", \" Thump-Gun \", \" Bloop Tube \", \" Big Ed \", \" Elephant Gun ,\" and \" Blooper \". The M79's inspect animation used to be broken, but in the Summer Update III , it got fixed. It is well known for not being used much, due to slight issues with the weapon's mechanisms. The M79, along with the RPG , the Bow , the Musket , the Golden Musket , the M16A2 's grenade launcher, the Pocket Potassium , and the Golden Gun are the only weapons in the game to hold a single round.

The M9 was adopted by the United States military as their service pistol in 1985. The M9 won a competition in the 1980s to replace the M1911A1 as the primary sidearm of the U.S. military, beating many other contenders, and only narrowly defeating the SIG Sauer P226 for cost reasons. It officially entered service in 1990. Some other pistols have been adopted to a lesser extent, namely the M11 pistol, and other models remain in use in certain niches. The M9 was scheduled to be replaced under a United States Army program, the Future Handgun System (FHS), which was merged with the SOF Combat Pistol program to create the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP). The JCP was renamed Combat Pistol (CP), and the number of pistols to be bought was drastically cut back. The U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps are replacing the M9 with the M17 and the M18. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The M9 was added during the Mega Update of Arsenal , carries 16-round magazine with 45 ammo in reserve. The M9 is best used at close quarters with its decent rate of fire and high close range damage. Players can expect to kill opponents who fight in close range within two or three shots, but it takes up to 7 shots to kill an enemy at long range. This can be attributed to the weapon's spread penalty, which severely lowers the chance to connect with an enemy at long range. Fortunately, this can be mitigated with a short waiting period between shots, though moving closer to the target should be a priority with this weapon. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Decent rate of fire. High magazine capacity for a pistol. High damage at close quarters. Fast reload. Cons: High spread upon continuous fire. Low minimum body damage. Tips [ ] The M9 is one of the less accurate Pistols in the game (but has more accuracy than the Peppergun ), so aiming straight at enemies won't do the trick with this weapon. Because of its accuracy, this weapon is only effective at close-range. With this in mind, the best strategy to use the M9 is to go for the head, then finish them off with bodyshots. This way, the first, more accurate bullets will hit their mark, while the later, less accurate bullets will still land. The M9, like the other Pistols, reloads quickly, allowing you to reload in an intense fight. Gallery [ ] In third person. M9 in real life. Trivia [ ] The old model and sounds were used for the Conventional , a secondary weapon used by the Flanker and Mechanic classes in Typical Colors 2 . But in the Summer Update III they received a new firing sound. This is the signature weapon for the Fanboy skin . Getting a headshot kill with the M9 while using the Fanboy skin will award the player with the \"Fanboy\" badge . The M9 also appears in Robber , another ROLVe Game, albeit silenced. The M9 was the standard issue pistol for the U.S Armed Forces. While still in active use by the USAF, it is currently being phased out by the Sig Sauer M17.

Ingram in 1964, and chambered in the .45 ACP and 9mm cartridges. Despite never being referred to officially as the MAC-10 (and as the M10), the name MAC-10 has seen such common usage that it is how the weapon is generally identified. In-Game Information [ ] The MAC-10 is slightly a faster-firing, lower-accuracy Uzi . Just like any other SMGs, it is very ineffective at long ranges, highly effective at close ranges, and has a hefty penalty of spread. It has a much higher spread penalty in comparison to other SMGs, so it's best to completely avoid mid-long range interaction. It also carries 30-round magazine, but its fire-rate can easily expend the ammo quickly. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Very fast fire-rate. Decent damage at close quarters. Extremely quick reload. Minimal spread. Cons: Low minimum body damage. Magazine is easily expended due to its fire-rate. Tips [ ] The MAC-10 can be used from any distance, even from long-range. However, more bullets will land if you're at least at mid-range. If shooting from long-range, avoid firing all of your bullets at once. Your shots will be more accurate if you stop firing for at least half a second, then started firing again. The MAC-10 is fast enough to kill any opponent without being shot back at. If you're coming to Arsenal as a Typical Colors 2 player, the MAC-10 in this game is similar to the MAC-10 that Marksman uses. The only difference is that Arsenal's version fires slightly faster and deals a lot more damage. However, it reloads slightly slower than TC2's own. Trivia [ ] The MAC-10 was actually made illegal to produce by the ATF in 1972, along with many other guns. The MAC-10 appeared in Typical Colors 2 , as a secondary weapon for the Marksman class, albeit with a different model. The MAC-10 is a compact, blowback operated machine pistol developed by Gordon. B. Ingram in 1964 that's usually chambered in .45 ACP or 9mm through a special conversion. Its 30-round-mag suggests that it fires .45 ACP rounds. The MAC-10's current and archived model has its stock folded, while the previous model has it unfolded. In real life, the early versions of the MAC-10 use the magazines of the left-over WW2 M3 Grease Gun to reduce cost. The MAC-10 uses the Uzi's reload animation, albeit with a different bolt cycle animation. The MAC-10 in game somehow operates as closed bolt inspite of it firing from the open bolt in real life Audio (Outdated) [ ] Firing Reloading https://robloxarsenal.fandom.com/wiki/File:Mac10-firing-sound.ogg https://robloxarsenal.fandom.com/wiki/File:Uzi-reload-sound.ogg Weapon History [ ] 08/18/15: Added into Gun Game . 04/18/16: Lightened base model. 04/21/16: Taken to the ALPHA phase of Arsenal . 08/09/16: Taken to the archived phase of Arsenal . 11/27/18: Removed from the Mega Update of Arsenal . 06/05/19: Re-added back to the Summer Update of Arsenal . 08/25/19: Fixed MAC-10's view model. 09/28/19: MAC-10's HUD/Kill icon changed. 05/16/20: Bullet spread nerfed from 40 to 20. 07/06/21: Added to the Counter Blox gamemode. 10/31/21: Received new firing and reload sounds. 08/18/25: Given a new model. v • t • e Pistols (28) Classic Pistol - Deagle - Dual Volcanics - Falkor - Five-SeveN - G-18 - G-19X - G-21 - Golden Gun - Golden Hush Puppy - Handcannon - Hi-Power - Hush Puppy - Kolibri - Literal Gun - Little Tom - Luger - M1911 - M9 - Makarov - Maxim-9 - Minifigure - Origami Gun - P250 - PRISMAS - Soul Pistol - TEC-9 - USP Revolvers (8) Classic Revolver - Dual LCRs - Electric Revolver - Pathbringer - Peacemaker - Peppergun - Python - Webley - Windicator SMGs (25) Classic P90 - Classic SMG - BH10 - FMG-9 - Grease Gun - MAC-10 - MAT-49 - MP5 - MP5K - MP5-SD - MP7 - MP9-S - Mauser Carbine - Micro Uzis - Model 635 - P90 - PP-Bizon - PPSH - STEN - Tommy Gun - UMP-45 - Uzi - Vector - War Group Relic - Z80 Shotguns (19) AA12 - Blunderbuss - Calico - Classic Shotgun - DB Shotgun - Dual Shotguns - Inertial Shotgun - Lever Shotgun - MAG-7 - Mossberg 500 - Nutcracker - Pump Shotgun - R800 - Saiga-12 - SPAS 12 - TOZ-106 - Tavor - Trench Gun - XM1014 Automatic Rifles (30) Armament - AR-PDW - AK47 - AK74 - AKM - AUG - BAR - Classic AUG - Classic Rifle - FAMAS - FN FAL - Focus - G11 - G3 - G36 - Galil - L86A3 - Laser Rifle - M14 EBR - M16A1 - M16A2 - M4A1 - MK18 - Nailgun - Potassium Power - Pulse Laser - SCAR-H - SCAR-L - SG550 - XR15 Marksman Rifles (11) ABS Rifle - Dragunov - Henry Rifle - M1 Garand - M14 - M1A1 Carbine - M1A1 Paratrooper - Peppermint Rifle - SKS - Spencer Carbine - Springfield Rifle Machine Guns (11) Candy Cane Miniguns - Classic Gatling - DB Chauchat - EM249 - Gatling Gun - M1919A6 Machine Gun - M249 - M60 - MG36 - MG42 - Minigun Sniper Rifles (13) AWP - Barrett - Classic Sniper - DBS - G3SG1 - Golden Musket - M40 - MS556 - Mosin-Nagant - Musket - Pulse Musket - Railgun - Sako 85 Specials (44) Acid Spitter - Arm Cannon - Autobow - Bomb - Baseball Launcher - Bow - Chord Tosser - Classic Crossbow - Classic Paintball Gun - Classic RPG - Classic Slingshot - Concussion Rifle - Cone Launcher - Crossbow - Dispenser - Explosive Barrel - Firework Launcher - Flamethrower - Golden Bomb - Golden Bow - Ice Stars - Kritzkrieg - Lightning Cannon - M79 - MGL - Ornament - PIZZA - Paintball Gun - Plasma Launcher - Pocket Potassium - Presents - Razor Bomb - Rocket Launcher - RPG - Slingshot - Snowball - Spellbook - Stake Launcher - Sunflower Sun - Superball - TP Launcher - Trash Can - Trowel - Ultraball - Water Balloon Melees (11) Firebrand - Darkheart - Golden Knife - Ghostwalker - Ice Dagger - Illumina - Knife - Squeaky Hammer - Sword - Venomshank - Windforce Exclusives (8) Admin Launcher - Bomb-Blaster - Fasticuffs - Golden Creagle - Influencer Launcher - OddBall - The Bomb - Very Long Bat Removed (19) C14 Timberwolf - CZ75-Auto - Creagle - Dual Berettas - Flaming Pumpkin - HE Grenade - M1917 - M24 - M4A1-S - M4A4 - MP9 - Negev - Nova - RJL BREACH - SCAR-20 - SVD - Sawed-Off - TOZ-34 - USP-S Miscellaneous (9) Battle Axe - Cannonball - FP-45 - Poison Potion - Rocket Jumper - Scout - Soul Rifle - Union Pistol - Zeus x27",

It was developed as a CQC (Close Quarters Combat) weapon which combined the concealed design of many submachine guns with the power of pump shotguns. It was originally manufactured with a civilian version alongside the normal version. The civilian version has a longer barrel and a fixed wooden stock. The version found in Arsenal is the original design. In-game Information [ ] The MAG-7 is an intermediate close-range weapon compared to other shotguns feeding on a 5-round magazine. the MAG-7 is capable of a 4-pellet kill anywhere on the body at close ranges, so aim should be taken at the head because of its very low damage. Along with its low damage, it also has huge spread. The firerate is very slow due to the pause after firing a shot. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Above-average maximum damage for its class. Magazine-fed means quicker reloads. Cons: Slow rate of fire. Small magazine size. Low minimum damage. Tips [ ] The MAG-7's less-than-ideal bullet spread requires the user to fight at close-range, instead of mid-range like most of the other Shotgun-class weapons. If you're stuck at mid-range, aiming at the upper-half of an opponent's body will help you deal respectable damage. Unlike the other Shotgun-class weapons, the MAG-7 reloads its entire magazine at one time. This will help you get back into fights quicker, but it will not help you if you're currently being shot at. Trivia [ ] The MAG-7 was the first magazine-fed shotgun in the game, soon followed by the Calico , AA12 , and TOZ-106 . The MAG-7 feeds from a stick magazine, the Calico feeds from a helical magazine, the AA-12 feeds from a drum magazine, and the TOZ-106 feeds from a box magazine. The MAG-7 was developed by Techno Arms PTY , a South African firearms company. It has never served in any law enforcement or military roles but is still manufactured to this day. It was developed as a close quarters combat shotgun, combining the aspects of a compact sub-machine gun and a pump-action shotgun. The MAG-7 uses a shorter, more obscure 12 gauge shell, using a 12 gauge x 60 mm cartridge compared to a 12 gauge x 69.85 mm cartridge most shotguns use today. The MAG-7 appeared in the archived version of Arsenal . However, instead of 5 shells per magazine, it has 8 shells per-magazine. ROLVe developers decided to reduce the magazine capacity to its current state in the Mega Update. This is the civilian version of the MAG-7, with a shorter barrel and removed stock. The MAG-7 is smaller in real life than it is in the game and is known for its bad ergonomics. The MAG-7 is able to be modded with an attachable stock and longer barrel in real life. If the max viewmodel is used, the reloading animation appears to be inaccurate; the player ejects the magazine but puts it back in. The MAG-7 firing and reloading sound is same as the MAG-7 from CS:GO before the major CSGO gun sound update.

Designed under the leadership of Nikolay Fyodorovich Makarov, it became the standard-issue sidearm for the Soviet military and Militsya in 1951. In-Game Information [ ] The Makarov has no capped fire-rate, meaning that players do not have to wait whatsoever until firing another shot, essentially meaning it has an unlimited fire-rate. It's also very accurate due to its low spread, meaning it's good at most ranges. Players should aim for headshots when using the Makarov , as the weapon's powerful two-shot kill to the head combined with its uncapped fire rate, means the Makarov can be used as a deadly and dangerous handgun. However, users should take note of the weapon's paltry 9-round magazine, which is somewhat offset by the Makarov's fast reload speed; when the users spammed with the Makarov , the magazine easily runs out for a while due to its uncapped fire-rate. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Very fast fire-rate. High damage at close quarters. Low spread. Very quick reload time. Cons: Low 9-round magazine capacity. Low minimum body damage. Magazine is easily expended due to its fire-rate. Tips [ ] The Makarov is often underestimated by opponents due to its weak damage. However, its insanely fast firing rate makes this weapon deadly at close-range. If you sneak up on or suddenly pounce on enemies, the Makarov's firing rate will let you quickly kill them without taking damage back. Do beware that the Makarov is less effective at mid-range, and least effective and long-range due to its minimal damage for bodyshots. From any distance, however, 1-2 headshots will kill opponents quickly. The Makarov will can quickly run out of ammo during intense fights, but its reload is quick enough to allow you to start firing again. Gallery [ ] In third person. Makarov in real life. Trivia [ ] The Makarov has the fastest firing rate among the Pistols in this game. The Makarov became the Soviet Union's standard police and military sidearm in 1951. It was made after WWII with motives to replace the Tokarev TT33 and Nagant M1895 sidearms. The mesh is from another ROLVe game, Unit 1968: Vietnam . This is the signature weapon of the Animatronic Rabblerouser, Rabblerouser, RottingRouser, Summer Rabblerouser, and Throwback Rabblerouser skins . A silenced version of the model was used as one of Agent's primary weapons, the Silenced Pistol . The reload animation in-game incorrectly depicts the gun as a thumb-release rather than a heel-release gun.

In-game Information [ ] The MAT-49, like any other SMG, functions poorly at long ranges. However, it is slightly more accurate than other SMGs. This makes it somewhat usable in mid-range. Due to its low magazine of 20, it's best to make every shot count. However, the MAT-49 has a slower than average rate of fire for an SMG which is both a blessing and a curse. The slow rate of fire would make it less suitable compared to faster firing weapons in CQC but will not easily consume your ammunition. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Quick reload. Low spread. Cons: Somewhat slow rate of fire. Small magazine size for its class. Trivia [ ] The MAT-49 can fire 600 rounds per minute on full-auto. It also had a modified version that used two triggers for different rates of fire. The MAT-49 in-game uses the converted variant that was used by the Viet Cong . They converted the gun to fire 7.62mm Tokarev instead of 9mm Parabellum. The MAT-49 was introduced in 1949 to the French Armed Forces and remained in service until it was replaced by FAMAS in 1978. The model in-game has its slot for the stock removed.

It has a magazine of 20 ammo, with 3 more magazines in reserve. In-game information [ ] The Mauser Carbine is similar to the MP9-S . However, the fire rate is slightly faster, it deals more damage, and the magazine is reduced to a mere 20, 10 rounds less than the MP9-S. It is also similar to the Focus, yet having a third of the damage but the same headshot damage. If players miss too much with this weapon, they will quickly find themselves in a bad spot, with reloading taking up a lot of precious time. The reload time is above average, so players can reload fast and get back into battle in no time. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Low spread and recoil. High damage. Extremely fast fire rate. Moderately fast reload. Slightly quieter shots do not reveal your location. Cons: Lower than average magazine size for its class. High ammo consumption rate. Low minimum damage. Magazine size easily expended due to fire rate. Tips [ ] The Mauser Carbine dominates intense fights. All it takes to get a kill is four landed shots, at the very least. This weapon also has a fast reload, which is another feature that makes it good at intense fights. Do note that the Mauser Carbine deals very weak damage at long-range. Stay at least within mid-range to get easier kills. While not a direct advantage, the Mauser Carbine's shots make softer sounds compared to other, louder weapons. Use this feature to hide your current loaction from opponents. Gallery [ ] The Mauser Carbine in real life with folded stock. Trivia [ ] The Mauser Carbine appears to be based on the PASAM submachine gun , a Brazilian derivative of the fully automatic Mauser M712 Schnellfeuer pistol . Although, the Carbine in-game has its wooden handguard extended towards the back. There are models of the Mauser pistols (including carbines) that either feed from an integral magazine or a detachable magazine. The Mauser was also known under the \" Broomhandle \" nickname due to the shape of the pistol grip. The variant in-game, the PASAM SMG , utilizes the 7.63x25mm Mauser cartridge. In-game, it seems to fire the .45 ACP cartridge for unknown reasons. The Mauser Carbine is the 4th weapon with a silencer to be added to the game. It is one of the seven guns to be equipped with a suppressor. The others are the MP9-S , the MK18 , the Hush Puppy , the Maxim-9 , the Sako 85 , and the Vector .

Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] In-game, the Maxim-9 is a two-shot kill at close ranges and at long ranges through headshots. Its fast rate of fire and silenced nature make it great for ambushes. The Maxim-9 has a fair magazine capacity of 17, however the fast rate of fire and high recoil cause frequent reloads. The reload time is quite slow when compared to other pistols, so try not to run out of ammo. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast rate of fire. High damage. Silenced shot does not give spot away for enemies. Large magazine and ammo count. Low overall spread. Cons: Somewhat high recoil. Tips [ ] The Maxim-9 is one of the most powerful Pistols in the game. Its high damage, fast firing speed, and large magazine size will guarantee easy kills, as long as your aim can withstand its recoil. This weapon is powerful enough to be used from mid-range, but it's more powerful at close-range. If close enough, a single headshot from mid-range will insta-kill. Beware that the recoil becomes too high for you to see clearly at 5-7 shots. If at close-range, you can spam your shots. But at mid-range, it's better to space them out. Gallery [ ] The 1st stage of development. Stage 2. Stage 3 (finished). Iron Sights. Maxim-9 in real life. Trivia [ ] The Maxim-9 is the second pistol to have a silencer, with the first being the Hush Puppy . It is also one of the seventh suppressed weapons in the game, with the other five being the Hush Puppy , the MK18 , the MP9-S , the Mauser Carbine , the Sako 85 , and the Vector . This was one of many weapons to be revealed by ROLVe through their social media, with the others being the FAMAS , the L86A3 (both through Twitter ), the FMG-9 , the Tavor (both through the Arsenal Discord server), the FMG-9 , the Micro Uzis , the Flamethrower , the Pocket Potassium , the Z80 , the Literal Gun , the Vector , the Pulse Musket , and the TP Launcher . The Maxim-9 was also revealed in the Arsenal Discord server. The Maxim-9's previous firing sound uses the same firing sound from the USP-S from CBRO . In real life, the Maxim-9 can be both semi-automatic and automatic, but this game features the semi-automatic version.

It was developed in the 1990s to complement the G36 assault rifle. Unlike the other variants of the G36 family of firearms, the MG36 was not very successful. It was never formally adopted. In-game information [ ] The MG36 performs similar to its assault rifle counterpart, trading movement speed for a 100-round Beta C-Mag . Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Low spread. High damage. Fast fire rate. Excellent ammo capacity. Decent reload time for a machine gun. Cons: Sluggish movement speed. Moderate recoil Tips [ ] The MG36 is the most accurate of all the Machine Guns due to its very low spread. You can practically use this weapon to snipe someone from a far distance if you don't get too reckless. If you're using the MG36 in a gamemode without the promotion-on-kill mechanic (Randomizer and Gun Rotation, for example), make sure to reload often to running out of ammo during an intense fight. The MG36 fires very quickly which will deplete its ammo in no time, so it's important to do this. Gallery [ ] One of the parts 1. One of the parts 2. One of the parts 3. The entire part merged. Finished model. Trivia [ ] The weapon was teased in the Arsenal Discord on May 23, 2021. While the MG36 is really just a G36 rifle fitted with a 100-round drum magazine, it has been upgraded to be equipped with a heavier barrel for continuous heavy fire.

It was designed to replace the earlier, more expensive MG 34, though both weapons continued to be in use and production up to the end. Most notably for the MG 42, the weapon has a cyclic rate of fire of 1,200 rounds per minute- a large volume of fire that made it a good candidate for suppressive fire, and earned it the name \"Hitler's Buzzsaw.\" In-game Information [ ] Players can expect a roller coaster of a weapon. The MG42 has one of the fastest fire rates in the game, meaning that users will quickly kill opponents in close to medium ranges. When burst fired, the MG42's spread penalty is sufficiently low enough to allow users to eliminate targets even at longer ranges. The really high damage helps too, and players can be killed in the blink of an eye. However, the weapon comes with two obvious downfalls; one being its low 50-round drum capacity for its class, made even smaller by the weapon's intense fire rate. This is not helped along by the MG42's reload time; players who empty out the weapon's drum will find themselves vulnerable for a lengthy period of time. However, since it takes so little rounds to kill a player anyway, any player who uses their rounds wisely will never have to deal with these issues. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros Insanely fast rate of fire. Very high damage up close. Low time-to-kill (TTK) at closer ranges due to devastating damage and fast fire rate. Very low recoil. Low spread for its class. Cons Sluggish movement speed. Grueling reload time. High ammo consumption rate. Low minimum body damage. Small magazine size for a machine gun. Expends it's ammo quickly due to its fire rate. Tips [ ] The MG42's minimal spread has a hidden advantage, as you won't have to move your aim too much to hit opponents. You can even hit opponents from far distances, More shots are likely to land if you position your crosshair on their head. At long-range, make sure you stop firing once in a while to reset the MG42's spread. Only the first 20 bullets are more accurate than the rest. Its incredibly slow reload time makes the MG42 a \"one-and-done\" weapon, as it prompts players to get a kill within the first clip, or face the consequences. If you don't want to wait out the slow reload, resorting to getting a backstab with your Knife can be an alternate solution. Trivia [ ] The MG42 is the fastest firing machine gun to be produced. It weighs about 25.57 pounds (11.6 kg), so in reality, carrying this would be extremely exhausting. The MG42's barrel can be swapped out and replaced in real life. The MG42 was taken from another game developed by ROLVe , Counter Blox . This weapon is also known as, \" Hitler's Buzzsaw. \" The MG42 in real life is usually used stationary with the bipod due to its high recoil.

This weapon was released in The Update of All Time of Arsenal . This weapon looks similar to how a revolver would look, but instead of the cylinder containing bullets, it contains grenades. The weapon is also depicted with a scope, but isn't present in-game. In-Game Information [ ] The MGL is an automatic grenade launcher that does heavy damage. It is essentially a direct upgrade of the M79 , with a faster firerate, faster reload, and the same 1-shot splash damage ability, but has slower movement speed Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Fast rate of fire. Rocket Jump ability. Insta-kills an enemy. Splash damage allows for area-of-effect kills. High ammo for an explosive. Multiple shots in case you miss.

The Micro Uzis were initially produced in the 1980s as a more compact version of the UZI. Each individual gun is weaker than the regular UZI, however, since they're both combined, they can yield greater damage, but also have a higher spread penalty. The Micro Uzis are one of the few dual wielded pistols in the game and the only automatic ones. It fires twice as fast as the regular UZI, shooting at a whooping 1250 RPM instead of the regular 600. There are a few drawbacks when it comes to the Micro Uzis, the most notable ones are the high bullet spread which would make it an inaccurate weapon and its low minimum damage. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Extremely high rate of fire. High damage in close range. High ammo capacity. Cons: High ammo consumption rate. High spread penalty. Long reload time. Low minimum body damage. Low accuracy. Tips [ ] The Micro Uzis are infamous for dominating close-ranged fights. It takes around 1 second for them to kill a nearby opponent. The most effective areas of a map to get a kill with this weapon is around corners, or jumping off a high platform and firing at an opponent below. Unlike their \"big brother\", the single Uzi , the Micro Uzis have very high spread, making them useless at mid-range and farther. However, the first 7-10 shots from the Micro Uzis are accurate enough to be used at mid-range. Use this for chip damage or to allow a teammate get you an assist. The Micro Uzis are a \"one-and-done\" weapon due to its ability to easily kill, but also with a slow reloading speed. Avoid emptying your ammo at all costs and make your shots count, or else you will be left vulnerable while reloading. However, it does take 3 seconds to reload, which isn't a long time if you're currently alone. Hide from enemies to reload and then jump back at them once loaded. Trivia [ ] It is one of the five dual-wielded weapons in the game along with the Dual Volcanics , the PRISMAS , Dual LCRs and the Dual Shotguns . It is also the first automatic dual-wielded weapon in the game. The second being the Dual Shotguns. The Micro UZI is the smallest in the UZI family, which includes the Mini UZI, the Uzi , and the UZI Pro. Micro UZI was initially produced by Israeli Military Industries in the 1980s as a super-compact version of the Uzi . Initially, it was sold only to members of the armored corps and special forces units of the Israeli Defense Forces , but due to several deals, the Micro Uzi would be manufactured by several U.S. companies. In real life, Micro UZI is classified as machine pistol, rather than an SMG, which is the same case for the MAC-10 . The Micro Uzi is a scaled-down version of the UZI that was introduced in the year 1986. It has an automatic fire of 1,250 RPM (rounds per minute) which is double the RPM of the regular Uzi. The Micro Uzis share the same firing and reload sounds with the Uzi from the Left 4 Dead series. Each click with the Micro Uzis shoots 2 bullets instead of one. There is a random bug where only half of the gun appears, this bug also removes the pull-out animation, reload animation and the fire animation, but you are still able to fire the weapon and kill somebody with it. It is unknown if this bug is patched or not. When the Micro UZIs were first added, the kill icon for the Micro UZIs was a crowbar. This was then changed to the UZI kill icon before it got a unique one This is one of many weapons which were revealed before they got added into the game including the L86A3 , the FAMAS , the Ice Stars , the Golden Gun , the FMG-9 , the Maxim-9 , the Tavor , the Flamethrower , the Pocket Potassium , the Z80 , the Literal Gun , the Vector , the Pulse Musket and the TP Launcher .

It's design resembles the official collectible Roblox figures created by toy company called Jazwares . Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The Minifigure rapidly shoots their blaster at the user's demands, hitting an enemy will deal a regular damage of 27 and 37 on a headshot at long ranges. When reloading, the user will give the Minifigure a magazine and reload it themselves. The Minifigure is the final weapon needed to win a game of Laser Tag . Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Decent rate of fire. Large magazine size for a pistol. High damage. Fast reload. Cons: High spread upon continuous shots. Tracer shot can give away the user's position. Tips [ ] The Minifigure is a rather tricky weapon. It shoots quickly and deals respectable damage, but its spread gets high very fast. The Minifigure's spread becomes too high after 6 shots. The Minifigure is practically effective from almost any distance. In short-range, especially during intense fights, the user can spam the Minifigure's shots, where a majority of them are guaranteed to hit the opponent. At mid-range, the Minifigure is still viable to spam, but not very quickly to avoid high spread. From long-range, the Minifigure performs best if shot only once per second, imitating a Marksman Rifle. Once again, the high spread won't help at far distances unless shots are spaced out. The Minifigure has a fast reload, but it's slightly slower than the other Pistols. Beware. Although this weapon shoots tracer shots, they are very short. The majority of the playerbase doesn't take advantage of these. Gallery [ ] Weapon development. Weapon render. Trivia [ ] The Minifigure was revealed in the Arsenal Discord on December 21st, 2020. The Minifigure is based on the Elflinquent skin holding a blaster pistol. The figure resembles the same shape as real ROBLOX figures. There's also a rare chance that the Minifigure will take on the appearance of the Astronaut skin. The Minifigure is the first weapon in Arsenal to have voicelines.

The Minigun was designed with the goal of helicopters to be equipped with an effective close-air-support weapon. In later years, the Minigun would both be used as a ground-based support weapon. However, pop culture created the myth of a handheld, multi-barrel machine of death, despite the real-life fact that hardly any human could lift, let alone wield such a weapon. However, the myth of the massive death machine would remain popular. In-game Information [ ] The Minigun runs off a single ammo pool of 800 rounds and has the highest ammo pool in-game. It is unique that it requires a windup period of 3 seconds before it is able to fire. However, players can \"rev up\" the weapon prematurely without firing by holding down RMB (right mouse button), although this will slow players down to the speed of crawling. The Minigun also comes with a heavy spread penalty that decreases immensely 3-5 seconds after players have begun revving up. It's best to jump before revving up, as jumping will keep your momentum mid-air. While the Minigun's damage is comparable to that of an SMG, its high rate of fire and large ammo capacity allows players to kill opponents at all ranges with ease. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Extremely high ammo pool of 150 rounds. No reloading required. Spread penalty deduction after 3 seconds of revving. Insanely fast fire rate. Pre-revving saves time. Can shoot 2 bullets at a time. Cons: Low mobility when firing or revving up. Must be revved up before firing. Low minimum damage. Somewhat high spread at first. May cause lag probably due to the size or the rev-up. High recoil. Tips [ ] Before turning any corners (where most enemies are most likely to be), make sure to hold RMB down to rev up. This will save you the 1 second pause between revving up and shooting if an enemy approaches you. You can hold both LMB and RMB to both fire this weapon and stay revved up after you stop shooting. Holding the Minigun will make you walk slower, especially if you rev it up. To move faster around the map, you should equip your Knife and switch back to the Minigun if you spot any enemies. Because the Minigun makes you slower, you'll be an easy target for any opponents with a Marksman Rifle or a Sniper Rifle. Try not to use the Minigun in very open spaces. Inside buildings or areas without anyone staring down the sightline are more advantageous for you. The Minigun's tighter spread can potentially kill an opponent from long-range. If you are coming to Arsenal as a Typical Colors 2 player, the Minigun is more or less the same. However, take note of its new stats: Compared to the Minigun from TC2, the Minigun for Arsenal has a tighter spread, so you can kill enemies from practically any distance. The Minigun also crits on headshot, which will make kills both fast and almost effortless. Just like facing off against enemy Agents, you are vulnerable to being demoted a level by an enemy's Knife if you are unaware. Stay vigilant to avoid being easily taken advantage of. Gallery [ ] Minigun in real life. Trivia [ ] The Minigun in-game is a six-barrel 7.62x51mm rotary machine gun more formally designated the M134 Minigun and is meant to be used on aircraft, sea vessels, land vehicles, and stationary positions. The large machine guns that were built on military vehicles were made smaller to be used by a human: hence the name \"Minigun\", despite its size still being big. The weapon's weight in real life is 85 pounds (39 kilograms), and still a hefty 41 pounds (19 kilograms) with the lightweight modifications, not including a power generator or ammo supplies. The Minigun's model and animations are imported from Typical Colors 2 , albeit minor differences like the fire rate and the ammo and the Arsenal version lacks of ammo pouches on the sides of the weapon. When getting a kill with the Minigun using the Brute skin , players can get the Right Person, Wrong Game Badge . This Badge references the Brute character from Typical Colors 2 , where his main weapon is the Minigun. The Minigun is the only weapon in the game in which the spread decreases the longer it's fired. It is the signature weapon of the Brute, Rhino &amp; Rider Brute skins. Whilst the Minigun got removed, the signature weapon of Brute was changed to the RPG , and then to the M60 , and Rhino's signature weapon was removed then changed to the M60. After the Minigun was brought back into the game, Brute's signature weapon was reverted to his original signature weapon. Originally, this weapon dealt horrifically low amounts of damage to balance the fire rate, however, this was then buffed. The Minigun has the highest ammo pool in the game. The main reason behind the Minigun's short removal from the game was because of the trouble to make it work with the new sound replication. This also caused the removed gamemodes, Typical Colors and Automatics to be broken. The Minigun was used for as an accessory for the Brute ROBLOX toy.

It was developed by the US Navy, as a low-profile replacement for the M4 and M16 series, not being ideally suited for all missions. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Gallery 4 Trivia 5 Audio 5.1 Previous 6 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] MK18's fast rate of fire helps with shredding enemies at any ranges combined with its ADS feature for extreme accuracy. It also has a suppressor, making its shots less audible. However, due to drawbacks, the MK18 has downsides, such as its low minimum damage, which means shredding at long range might be a problem, and even though the MK18 has an ADS ability, hip-firing will result in a high spread penalty. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros Decent damage in close quarters. Accessible sight. Fast fire rate. Silenced shots make it harder to reveal a player's position. Moderate magazine size. Cons Low first shot accuracy. Low minimum damage. High spread upon hip-firing. Long reload time. Magazine is quickly emptied due to fast fire rate. Gallery [ ] ADS Previous ADS MK18 in real life. Trivia [ ] The MK18, also known as the CQBR (close quarters battle receiver) , is an M4A1 Carbine with a replacement upper receiver that makes the weapon become more compact and easier to maneuver in tight, confined spaces, similar to the old Colt Commandos of the past. The MK18 firing sound is same as the old M4A1-S from CS:GO . It used to be the signature weapon of John Brick, as evident by the The Boogeyman badge where one must get a kill using the John Brick Skin with an MK18. However, in the Christmas Update , John Brick's signature weapon was changed to a pencil melee. The MK18 is the third silenced weapon to be added to the game. It is also one of the seven silenced weapon in the game with the others being the Maxim-9 , Hush Puppy , Sako 85 , MP9-S , the Mauser Carbine and the Vector . The MK18 is one of the weapons that has the ability to ADS. The others are the DB Chauchat , the M14 EBR , the Falkor , the Vector , the Pulse Musket and DBS . There is a glitch where the crosshair isn't visible with this weapon. First of all scope with this weapon, and switch to the knife. Now you don't have a crosshair. Also, hipfiring will have no spread and lower recoil, using a custom crosshair will make this weapon overpowered. This also happens with the other weapons which have access to ADS, however, the results can be different. Originally, if the player has minimized viewmodels setting on and accesses the sight, the ADS model will appear lower on the screen.

The overall aesthetics are identical to most M16 type rifles. Changes include a large plastic gas deflector protruding from the rear quarter of the ejection port, and a correspondingly shorter dust cover. Factory Colt 9mm SMGs are equipped with a 10.5 inch length barrel and have an M16 style upper receiver, which means they feature a fixed carry handle, no forward assist and A1 sights (with 50 and 100 meter settings). The magazine well of the receiver is modified with pinned-in blocks to allow the use of smaller 9 mm magazines. The magazines themselves are a copy of the Israeli UZI SMG magazine, modified to fit the Colt and lock the bolt back after the last shot. In-game Information [ ] The Model 635 is an automatic sub-machine gun that was added in the Summer Update III of Arsenal . Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fall off allows close range shredding.

The production of the Mosin–Nagant started in the Russian Empire during 1891. In-game Information [ ] The Mosin-Nagant is best used as a marksman's weapon. A shot to the head will instantly kill an enemy regardless of distance, and will always two-shot kill an opponent to the body at far range. However, players are advised to aim for the head, as the Mosin-Nagant has extremely slow bolt cycling, requiring players to wait a brief time longer than the Windicator 's reload time. It also has two unique features: one is being reloaded one-by-one. This can be a boon if players need to fire while reloading, although a full reload from empty will be punishing. The second is the fall-off, which allows the Mosin-Nagant to deal more damage at closer ranges. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Ramped-up damage if near opponents. Insta-kills if shot point-blank. Scope allows for better magnification. Reloaded 1-by-1, making it efficient when needing to fire while reloading. No spread or recoil. Cons: Slow movement speed. Slowest rate of fire in-class. Punishing reload time if the magazine is empty. Low ammo in reserve. Scope tracer may give away position Tips [ ] The Mosin-Nagant is one of the most versatile weapons in the game, as it can snipe from a distance and deal respectable damage up close. Sniper Rifles generally lose to Automatic Rifles and Shotgun-classes in close-quarters combat. The Mosin-Nagant is an exception as it deals hefty damage at close-range, making the user a threat that cannot be underestimated. Any bodyshot can potentially deal enough damage for a teammate to finish your job, giving you credit as an assist. You can also pull out your Knife and hit your target with a non-backstab to demote them. The most crippling downside of the Mosin-Nagant is its slow firing speed, which makes it less useful during intense fights despite its ramped-up damage. Make your shots count, even if flicking your aim. Keep the Mosin-Nagant at the ready before you turn corners, just in case you bump into an opponent or two. The Mosin-Nagant's slow firing speed can be sped up if you double-key (switch to your melee and back quickly). Trivia [ ] The Mosin-Nagant's official designation is the \" 3-line rifle M1891 \", although it is more commonly known in the West as the Mosin-Nagant and in Russia as Mosin's Rifle. The version featured in the game is the M91/30 sniper version of the rifle. Its bolt is bent and is equipped with a PU scope. The Mosin is one of the most produced bolt-action rifles in history, with a total of 37 million units having been produced since the Mosin's first creation in 1891. It is still used to this day by various nations. The Mosin itself also appeared in Typical Colors 2 as a old model of a primary weapon for Marksman (Known as Efficient Eliminator ) The in-game Mosin-Nagant does not have a trigger. The firing sound is taken from ROLVe's Vietnam War game, Unit 1968 , from the Mosin Nagant. The Mosin-Nagant's inspect animation is currently broken. Gallery [ ] Mosin-Nagant in real life.

Mossberg &amp; Sons. The 500 series comprises widely varying models of hammerless repeaters, all of which share the same basic receiver and action, but differ in bore size, barrel length, choke options, magazine capacity, stock and forearm materials. Model numbers included in the 500 series are the 500 , 505 , 510 , 535 , and 590 . In-game Information [ ] The Mossberg 500 's high damage per pellet is a great role in damaging enemies at long range, and just like the Pump Shotgun , the Mossberg 500 also has a 1-by-1 reload, meaning players can shoot while reloading. This doesn't come without any problems, however, since the Mossberg 500 has a wide pellet spread, meaning picking off enemies at longer ranges may be harder than other shotguns. Other drawbacks that come to mind are the slow rate of fire and the small ammo capacity of 5. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Very high damage per pellet. 1-by-1 reloading allows topping off. High minimum pellet damage for its class. Moderate ammo capacity. Firerate can be increased by double keying Cons: Slow empty reload time. Wide pellet spread. Slow rate of fire. Sluggish movement speed Tips [ ] The Mossberg 500's bullet spread is \"uneven\", meaning that it fires in a somewhat fixed pattern but is still too wide. To guarantee that more pellets will land, the solution as always is to get closer to opponents before firing. This \"uneven\" bullet spread will not help with firing at opponents on higher platforms. However, it is viable when jumping off and pouncing on opponents. Get closer to opponents by holding out your Knife , then switching back to the Mossberg 500 when in effective range. Trivia [ ] The Mossberg 500 is one of the more ubiquitous shotguns in the world, and is extremely easy to clean &amp; maintain. The model for the Mossberg 500 was used for Typical Colors 2 as the Gutbuster . The Mossberg in-game appears to have the elements of the \"shockwave\" variant, due to the iron sights and the grip, and the normal variant, due to the stock. When reloading the Mossberg 500, the player will not pump it after it has finished reloading, unlike other shotguns in the game. This is the signature weapon of the John, Woods, Mechanic and Arsonist skin . This weapon also used to be the signature weapon of the Paintballer skin. GALLERY [ ] Mossberg 500 in real life.

Adopted by 40+ countries, it’s used by militaries, police, and paramilitary forces worldwide. In-game Information [ ] The MP5 is highly versatile, offering a fast fire rate, decent close-range damage (54 to the head, 43 to the torso), and low recoil. Its stability makes it effective in various combat scenarios. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Automatic Low-Recoil Low-Spread Quick Reload Accessible sight Cons: Far-range damage is poor. Trivia [ ] It uses animations from another ROLVe game, Enforcement . Weirdly enough you can aim down sights for this gun, despite it only having iron sights.

This was removed in the Mega Update and replaced with the MP5K , but it was later brought back in the 10 Year Anniversary Update . This version of the MP5 uses a supressor attatchment, making its shots less audible. In-game Information [ ] The MP5-SD was relatively easy to kill with, but because it was low with damage, it was also easy to get killed with. It had a good magazine size and also a good ammunition reserve. All of this is completed with the low recoil, low spread, and very fast fire rate that was completely made better with the fast reload. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Low recoil and spread. Fast fire rate. Somewhat fast reload. Moderate magazine size. Supressor reduces noise considerably. Cons: Low body damage. Tips [ ] The MP5-SD is one of the easier weapons to get a kill with due to its fast firing speed, plus its low recoil and spread. This weapon dominates mid-ranged fights, so take advantage against players with close-ranged weapons like Shotguns or Pistols. Gallery [ ] A Solid Color MP5-S. Current MP5-SD in real life. Archived MP5-SD in real life. Trivia [ ] It is the first MP5 variant ever added in Arsenal (being added during the game's release under name \"Gun Game\" ). The second being the MP5K (added in the Mega Update in 2018), and the third being the MP5 (added in the Ocean Day Update in 2024). MP5-SD is one of an few archived weapons that still persisted their Gun Game design. It is also the only returning weapon in Arsenal that still persisted their Gun Game design, albeit with some minor differences. The current model is an A2 model with a fixed stock, while the archived model is an A3 model with a collapsible stock. The un-suppressed version, MP5 was originally going to be added to the game under the name of SMG by choice. Instead, the UMP-45 was chosen to be added. &#91; 1 &#93; The MP5-SD is a renamed variant of the MP5SD2 , a full stock, semi/full-automatic fire submachine gun. It is the only kind of MP5 that was redesigned majorly to MP5K . In 1974, Heckler &amp; Koch worked on a sound-suppressed of the regular MP5 , and made the MP5SD3 (or the in-game MP5-S) which featured an integral but a detachable aluminium sound suppressor and a lightweight bolt. MP5D3 has a retractable buttstock, \"SEF\" trigger group and an integrated suppressor. The MP5D3 is a variant of the MP5A3 which has a retractable butt and selector for bursts of three shots but however, The MP5D3 has an integrated suppressor unlike the MP5A3. The MP5SD1 , MP5SD2 and MP5SD3 use a standard \"SEF\" trigger group (from the MP5A2 and MP5A3) There's another version of the MP5SD3, the MP5SD-N , which is the MP5SD3 with a retractable metal stock, front sight post with tritium-illuminated dot and a stainless steel suppressor. Along with the MP5 weirdly enough, you can aim down sights with MP5SD despite it only featuring iron sights. Weapon History [ ] 2016 2018 2025 April 18th, 2016 Added MP5-S into Gun Game .

Designed for close-quarters combat, the MP5K retains the reliability and performance of the original MP5 while offering greater maneuverability. Widely used by military, police, and security forces, it is valued for its compact size and low recoil. In-Game Information [ ] This gun boasts an impressive rate of fire, a reasonable reload time, and solid headshot damage, guaranteeing at least a four-shot kill at any range, making it quite dependable in combat. However, its minimum damage is relatively low. To compensate, players should focus on closing the distance to their targets or aiming for headshots. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast rate of fire. High damage at close quarters. Fairly fast reload. Moderate magazine size. Fairly low spread. Cons: Low minimum body damage. Tips [ ] The MP5-SD is one of the easier weapons to get a kill with due to its fast firing speed, plus its low recoil and spread. This weapon dominates mid-ranged fights, so take advantage against players with close-ranged weapons like Shotguns or Pistols. Trivia [ ] The MP5K is simply a shortened version of the MP5 family. During its release, it was known as the MP5. It was quickly changed to MP5K due to its small size. This is the signature weapon of the Communicator skin. Initially, the MP5K was the signature weapon for the Ace Pilot, but it was replaced by the Handcannon in the August Update and later restored in the Anniversary Update . However, it became the signature weapon for the Communicator instead. In the Christmas Update , Ace Pilot's signature weapon was changed to the P90 . The MP5K' s firing animation includes a small error wherein the charging handle moves backwards after firing the weapon. During the reload animation, the player's character will slap the charging handle. This is known as the “HK Slap”. Gallery [ ] MP5K in real life.

It was designed together with the new cartridge to meet NATO requirements published in 1989, which called for an SMG-type weapon that had a greater capacity to defeat Kevlar body armour than pre-existing submachine guns using conventional pistol cartridges such as .45 ACP and 9×19mm Parabellum. The MP7 went into production in 2001, and is a direct rival to the FN P90, also developed in response to NATO's requirement by Belgian company FN Herstal. The weapon has been revised since its introduction and the latest production variants are the MP7A1 and MP7A2 . The proliferation of cheap yet effective soft body armor has begun to make guns that fire pistol ammunition (such as Heckler &amp; Koch's earlier MP5 submachine gun and USP pistol) ineffective. In response to this trend, Heckler &amp; Koch designed the MP7 (along with the cancelled UCP pistol, which uses the same ammunition) to penetrate soft body armor while being small enough to be used in place of either a pistol or a submachine gun. In-game Information [ ] The MP7 is a close-quarters oriented SMG, with a fairly high rate of fire and high spread to boot. It uses a large 40-round magazine, making it a very ammo-efficient weapon despite its fast rate of fire. The damage is remarkably decent in CQC, dealing up to 46 damage to the head at closer ranges and trailing down to 12 damage to the body at maximum range. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage at close quarters. Fast rate of fire. Fairly fast reload. Fairly low spread. Large magazine size of 40. Cons: Very low minimum body damage. Trivia [ ] The MP7, or Maschinenpistole 7 , was developed in response to NATO requirements for a new PDW firearm. PDWs are a hybrid between the Carbine and the SMG, allowing for greater armor penetration compared to SMGs, and a form factor small enough to easily be carried. The MP7 is the signature weapon of Broadcaster. The MP7 firing sound is same as the old MP7 from CS:GO . The MP7 in game has relatively high recoil contrary the MP7 in real life, in fact, low recoil is one of the selling points of the MP7. Gallery [ ] MP7 in real life without sights.

In-game Information [ ] The MP9-S is a powerful sub-machine gun. It stays accurate up to mid-long range, and combined with its silenced nature, allows players to effectively kill targets farther than most sub-machine guns could without risk of return fire. It does not lose any close-range effectiveness, however. The MP9-S's rate of fire grants it a rather quick time to kill. As with a majority of sub-machine guns, players have a high walk speed. However, its low damage means that players will have to rely on both their accuracy and the weapon's accuracy, as it can take upwards of 5 shots at farther ranges before an enemy is killed. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast fire rate. Moderately low spread Moderately quick reload. Silenced shots won't give away your position for enemies. Cons: Low minimum damage. Magazine is easily expended due to fast fire rate. Spread is not low enough to be used beyond mid-range. Tips [ ] The MP9-S has an \"uneven\" bullet spread, meaning that it fires in a somewhat fixed pattern but is still too wide. This makes it only effective at close-range, but the spread is still low enough to be used at mid-range. For this weapon, there really isn't need to \"space out your shots\", because all of your bullets can be shot before the spread becomes to high. As usual, the spread is not low enough to be used at longer distances. Any attempts to do so will be useless. The reload is fast, but not fast enough to help you start firing again in an intense fight. Make sure your shots count. Trivia [ ] It is the silenced version of the MP9 , a weapon found previously in Arsenal Archived . A previous glitch allowed this weapon (along with many others) to deal upwards of 5000 damage if combined with the chickens from the egg hunt. A video of this glitch can be found here . The MP9-S is found in other games, such as the TMP or Schmidt Machine pistol from the old Counter Strike games (From 1.0 to Source) or in CSGO but without a silencer. The previous MP9-S firing sound was also taken from the TMP in Counter Strike: Source. This was included in the Counter Blox gamemode, although a suppressed MP9 never actually appeared within that gamemode, although in Counter Blox there is MP-9, but not suppressed. At one point, the gun had its firing sound removed with the rest of the silenced weapons. This was changed in the Showtime! Update . The MP9-S is the second weapon with a silencer to be added to the game along with the MK18 , the Hush Puppy , the Mauser Carbine , the Maxim-9 , the Sako 85 and the Vector . The reload sound sounds similar to the Counter Blox audio, except slowed down.

In-game Information [ ] In-game, the MS556 is a 7-round sniper rifle comparable to the M40 . Players can expect a constant 65 damage at all ranges to the body and an instant kill to the head at all ranges, dealing 182 damage to a player. The weapon has no recoil and player's shots will always hit at the crosshair. The MS556's scope can be accessed by players using the RMB. Players can take shots without scoping in for CQC and medium range combat, but scoping is recommended for long range. The MS556's fire-rate is somewhat faster than that of other sniper rifles. Though this is an advantage in some aspects, it also means it can somewhat deplete ammo faster than other sniper rifles. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros High damage. Scope allows for better magnification. Perfect accuracy. Cons Lengthy reload. Small magazine size. Slow fire rate. Scope tracer may give away position. Tips [ ] The MS556 is best at exclusively long-range compared to the other Marksman Rifles, as its mid-range combat ability is not as effective. If an enemy pounces on you while you are sniping, a quick shot to their body will deal 65 damage, which will hopefully be enough for a teammate to get an assist for you. It does have a fast fire-rate which will help you fight off an opponent at mid-range, but most of the time this will depend on your opponent having a bad weapon or aim. Even with 7 shots per magazine and 2 bodyshots for a kill, you should still make your shots count. The MS556's reload is slow and it won't help you if you're currently being shot at. Trivia [ ] The MS556 is a fictional weapon chambered for 5.56 and using a detachable magazine. However, 5.56mm snipers have been made. The MS556 is a mix of the M700, the C14 Timberwolf and the M40A5 Sniper Rifle. The MS556 was able to be fired at a rate similar to that of most semi-automatic rifles, but that has since been fixed and it now fires at a speed closer to that of the M40 . In the early version of the Mega Update , it performed far worse than how it performs in it's current state, as the body shot would deal a minimal 40 damage, as well as having a low ammo pool (5/15). It was later buffed over time. The MS556's model and sound effects are seemingly reused from the M40, though with a few differences, such as it's color and an added reload animation. It is the signature weapon of Marksman skin . The MS556 replaced the C14 Timberwolf from Arsenal Archived .

The Musket seen in Arsenal appears to be based on a Percussion Cap musket, which appeared in the early-to-mid-19th century and usually fired a .58 caliber Minie Ball and was usually rifled. In-game Information [ ] The Musket is known for being both famous and infamous. It easily kills enemies with its over-the-top 600 bodyshot damage with 750 damage upon a headshot, instantly killing a player. On top of this, it has perfect accuracy, so all a player has to do is aim, and a kill will come rather quickly. However, it is infamous for its long reload of 6 seconds, whereas it only has a magazine of 1. This is extremely crucial to game time and survival. The Musket requires perfect aiming when shooting. If a player misses a shot, they are most likely going to lose a lot of time or die because of the Musket's notoriously long reload. It is an all-or-nothing weapon, backed up by the fact that the Musket can only fit one round. It acts like the Golden Gun in a sense, as both have one round but instantly kill. Because of this, the main problem with this weapon comes when players miss with it. This is due to a glaring downside, which is it's reload time. Since the Musket only has one round in its magazine, players will need to reload every time they fire. However, the sense of an all-or-nothing weapon goes away in the gamemodes Gun Rotation and Randomizer due to it's lengthy reload and 1 magazine capacity. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros One-shot kill on any part of the body across all ranges. Perfect accuracy. Cons Grueling 6-second reload time. Only one round in the chamber, so the weapon must reload every time after firing. Tips [ ] It must be noted that the Musket is the hardest Sniper Rifle to get a kill with (and most of the community say it's the hardest weapon overall). This weapon tests your patience and your ability to remain calm when aiming. Flicking your aim and shooting recklessly won't help you with this weapon. Because the Musket does not have a scope, its effective range is only at mid-range. It does have perfect accuracy, so you can still try to shoot from long range. From this distance, however, it is recommended to stay still and crouch to carefully take aim. If you cannot wait for the 6 second reload, your only other option is your Knife . Working on your melee combat is important because it can help you get a kill despite having a defective weapon like the Musket. Even if you get killed while fighting with your Knife, respawning is faster than reloading the Musket. In the rare chance that every player gets the Musket in the Gun Rotation gamemode , you should use your Knife instead of shooting the Musket, as this guarantees you more kills than everyone else. If you're still confident that you can reload the Musket, find a hiding place so you can do it without being attacked. Hiding in a corner, a small room, or on a higher platform are good places to sit down and reload. Trivia [ ] This weapon has the second highest damage in both head and body in the game per bullet, tied with the Tavor slug shell, only to be surpassed by the Literal Gun . The Musket has the longest reload time per bullet, with 6 seconds per bullet, which greatly surpasses every other weapon in the game, which all have reload times of less than 2 seconds per bullet. However, it does not have the longest reload time per magazine, being second to the Dual Volcanics , which takes a whopping 18 seconds to reload if the magazine is emptied out. Reloading in real life would have taken much longer, as the average reload speed of a rifleman during the 18-19th century was usually 20 seconds. The Musket is based on the 19th century-pattern percussion rifle called the Springfield 1861. Notably, the Springfield 1861 had a rifled barrel, much like later musket models. This allowed it to fire its Minie Balls accurately for up to a distance of over 500 yards. These kinds of muskets are known as \"rifled muskets\". The Musket, along with the Pocket Potassium , the Golden Gun , the Bow , the RPG , the M203 , the Spellbook , and the M79 are the only weapons in the game that carry a single round. In Gun Rotation and Randomizer, getting a kill with this weapon will allow you to fire the next shot almost instantaneously without the need to reload. However, missing will result in the grueling 6-second reload. The Musket is the signature weapon of the GOC Past skin . The Musket is the only sniper rifle to not have a scope ability. The old firing sound of the Musket is the firing sound of the Rifle from Mount &amp; Blade: Napoleonic Wars .

The Nailgun has perfect accuracy without spread, making it useful at any range, similar to the Laser Rifle and the Pulse Laser . This weapon has an incredibly fast fire rate and it will kill the enemy easily, however it also quickly empties its ammo capacity due to this. Contents 1 Pros &amp; Cons 2 Trivia 3 Audio 4 Weapon History Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast fire rate. Large 60-round magazine. Perfect accuracy. No recoil. Decent damage at close quarters. Cons: Low minimum damage. Reload is fairly slow. Somewhat slow movement speed. Trivia [ ] The Nailgun is based on David Wiggins' customized variant of an AR15, styled as a DeWalt Nailgun. The Nailgun's stats/base have been combined from 3 weapons: the damage is similar to the Tommy Gun , the model is similar to the M4A1 , and the spread, fire rate and magazine size are similar to the Laser Rifle and the Pulse Laser . The old firing sound effect was inherited from the Syringe Gun , used by the Medic in Team Fortress 2 , albeit higher pitched. The sound was updated in the Summer Update III to sound more like an actual Nailgun. The Nailgun uses a magazine shaped like an electric drill battery. It's magazine reads, \"NAILZ\". The Nailgun shoots bullets, despite being called a Nailgun. This is the signature weapon of the Joe skin .

In-game Information [ ] The Negev comes with power in close quarters. Its ability to one-shot kill and its fast rate of power ensures that nearby enemies will get killed quickly. It also has a high magazine size, so running out of ammo is rare. However, due to drawbacks, the Negev has a very low minimum damage of 1, meaning all 100 shots have to directly hit the player. It also had terrible spread and combined with the low damage of 1, it instantly makes the weapon useless to use at long ranges. It also had a long reload time. Pros and Cons [ ] Pros: High close range damage. High magazine. Very fast fire rate. Cons: Long reload time. High spread penalty. Extremely low minimum damage of 1. Slow movement speed. Trivia [ ] This is another overseas weapon, being a NATO weapon.

It has a gear which doesn't appear to be used for anything. Unlike all the other shotguns, it fires nuts instead of pellets. (The nuts are still hitscan.) Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High maximum damage. More accurate than most other shotguns. Magazine-fed means quicker reloads. Cons: Slow rate of fire. Somewhat slow reload, Low magazine size. Low pellet count. Fires a random pattern instead of a fixed pattern. Tips [ ] The Nutcracker's randomized pellet/nut spread means that you cannot risk any chances at mid-range. This weapon performs best at close range where every pellet/nut is guaranteed to hit. Running with your Knife then switching back to the Nutcracker can help you close the distance quickly. If still fighting at mid-range, aiming at the upper body of your opponent will make it more likely to get a headshot. Because of the randomized spread, aiming directly for the head will make it more likely that you will miss. Aim for the opponent's chest and you will deal respectable damage. Make all of your shots count, as the Nutcracker's reload is particularly slow. It does load in the entire magazine at once, however. The Nutcracker performs well when firing at opponents below you, but will not be as handy if fighting opponents above. Trivia [ ] The Nutcracker is currently the only shotgun to fire in a random pattern. Previously, the R800 fired in a random pattern when it was released. The world model appears to be team-colored. The Nutcracker's previous firing sound was taken from the Widowmaker from Team Fortress 2 .

Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Trivia 5 Audio 6 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The Origami Gun functions similarly to the G-17 , albeit with lower damage, a slower rate of fire and a smaller magazine that matches Hi-Power . The Origami Gun's biggest strengths are its high magazine size and a lack of spread. Its three-shot kill headshot capability at closer ranges means that killing enemies will not be a challenge. However, the Origami Gun's lack of spread trades for the slower rate of fire compared to its class. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast reload, as shared with the pistols of the game. Somewhat large magazine capacity. Has no spread. Cons: Slower rate of fire compared to some other pistols. Very low damage range. Tips [ ] The Origami Gun is one of the less effective Pistols in the game, due to its abyssmal damage range. It takes an average of 8 shots to completely shut down an opponent with this weapon. Just like every Pistol but especially this one, do not use the Origami Gun at long-range. Its fall-off is incredibly weak, only dealing 19 damage per shot. Treat the Origami Gun as if it is a Shotgun, as it's only just effective at close-range. This will ramp-up your damage as much as possible. 4 bodyshots or 3 headshots will kill nearby targets. Keep an eye out for opponents with much more powerful weapons, such as Automatics, Shotguns, or other Pistols. Once you start firing, you need to kill your target as soon as possible before they can fire back. This is the only way you can get a kill with the Origami Gun. Alternatively, you can switch to your Knife and attempt a melee kill or backstab to promote from the Origami Gun. If all else fails, your last resort would be to land at least 1-3 shots, and hope that a teammate finishes the job so you can promote off an assist. Trivia [ ] The Origami Gun was listed as just Origami in the DevForum post for Summer Update II . The Origami Gun is one of the joke weapons along with the Literal Gun , the Pocket Potassium , the Potassium Power , the TP Launcher , the Dispenser , and the Very Long Bat . The Origami Gun uses the same firing sounds as the Hi-Power.

The P250 chambered into 9x19mm was first revealed by the North American market on November 7th, 2007, and it was followed by the .45 ACP model in February of 2008. The last P250 models were released in 2009 and 2017, and production of the P250 halted as SIG Sauer moved on to the P320 . Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The P250 is the middle of the line pistol one can rotate onto, dealing a measly 14 damage on the body and 43 damage on the head at long range. In close range this weapon can 2 shot body and 1 shot head, making it very effective at close range. While its fire rate is capped, the large magazine helps to guarantee a user will not have to reload while fighting an opponent. It is not advised to use the P250 at long range, especially going for body shots as its spread penalty, recoil, and low long-range body damage means players will have trouble fighting off opponents. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage at close quarters. Quick reload. Large magazine size. High headshot damage. Cons: Low minimum body damage. High spread upon continuous shots. Somewhat capped fire-rate. Tips [ ] The P250 is a fairly easy weapon to get a kill with, as long as you stay within mid-range. At close-range, the P250 is the most deadly, as it takes a maxmimum of two shots to get a kill. It has a spread penalty that's very ineffective at longer distances, so it's important to aim for nearby targets instead. The P250 is practically weak when hitting bodyshots, so aim for the head as much as you can. Remember that it has a bit of recoil and spread, so this may be tricky. Just like the rest of the Pistols in the game, its reload speed is fast enough to reload in the middle of an intense fight. Gallery [ ] P250 in real life. Trivia [ ] Just like its counterpart in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive , the P250 has extremely low body shot damage, giving it the nickname \" Swiss BB \", although this nickname is no longer in wide usage. Because of the Counter Strike series, the P250 is falsely known to be used by Counter-Terrorism organizations, in fact, they were mostly used by police. As of January 2018, the P250 was no longer found on the Sig Sauer website due to discontinuation. The P250 in Gun Game was burst fire. As well as 9x19mm Parabellum, it uses .22 Long Rifle, .380 ACP, 9×19mm Parabellum, .357 SIG, .40 S&amp;W, and .45 ACP.

It was designed in accordance with NATO's request for a compact weapon that could defeat Kevlar body armor, as the prior 9mm firearms were generally unable to penetrate such armor. Its unique attribute is its magazine. A long, flat cartidge (commonly black, sometimes orange) that slides into the top of the barrel instead at the bottom, unlike other weapons. In-game Information [ ] Current Archived The P90 's fast fire rate is effective at close-quarters and mid-distance. Its high headshot damage has the potential to kill enemies in three headshots. However, the P90 has a longer reload time than other SMGs. Unlike today's P90 in Arsenal , the old Arsenal P90 (simply known as Heavy SMG in Gun Game ) had similar damage to the Tommy Gun in today's Arsenal , albeit it had a lower body damage. The spread on the old P90 was considered very high, forcing users to mitigate closer to shred enemies. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage at close quarters. Fairly low recoil and spread. Fast fire rate. Quick movement speed. Large magazine and ammo reserve. Cons Low minimum body damage. Below average reload speed. Tips [ ] The P90 shoots quickly and is almost perfectly accurate, meaning that you can easily win most engagements with opponents before they even fire a shot. Exceptions would be any opponents with any Sniper Rifle or Shotgun, as they can potentially one-shot you before you can kill them. The P90 is viable to use from any distance , although it is most powerful at close-range. If firing from longer ranges, don't use all of your ammo at once. Shoot around 15 bullets at a time and stop for a second to reset your accuracy. You may have 50 bullets per magazine and a fast reload, but it is still best to reload constantly. The P90 uses ammo very quickly , so it's best to keep it loaded to avoid running out of ammo during intense fights. This also applies to gamemodes without the promote-on-kill mechanic such as Randomizer or Gun Rotation. Gallery [ ] A yellow Solid Color P90 in Arsenal Archived . P90 in real life. Trivia [ ] The P90 is a compact personal defense weapon (PDW) designed and manufactured by FN Herstal in Belgium. Created in response to NATO requests for a replacement for 9×19mm Parabellum firearms, the P90 was designed as a compact but powerful firearm for vehicle crews, operators of crew-served weapons, support personnel, special forces, and counter-terrorist groups. It is one of the few weapons in Arsenal Archived that was taken from CBRO . During the time it was re-released, the P90 had the appearance of the MP5K in third person. The P90's kill icon also had the MP5K's. It is the signature weapon of the Ace Pilot, Cait, Cyber Defence Unit, Holiday Pilot, Rookie and Reindeer skins. When it was re-released, it had a magazine of 20 rounds. This was changed to 50 prior to the Community-Ops Update . The firing, and reload sound effects may have been taken from a video titled pee-9-tee made by a small gun animating YouTube channel called MintiMintness. The model in-game is based on the TR variant.

The Paintball Gun was inspired by ROBLOX 's BrickBattle Paintball Gun . In-game Information [ ] In-game, the Paintball Gun has a fast fire rate and infinite ammo, but has the low magazine capacity of 20. The Paintball Gun can almost instantly kill an enemy with its fast fire rate to make it easier for several people. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast fire rate. Has no spread. Infinite ammo. High damage. Quick projectile speed. Cons: Slow, delayed reload. No headshot multiplier. Projectile arch makes it harder to hit enemies at further ranges. Low magazine capacity of 20. Magazine is easily expelled due to its fast rate of fire. Trivia [ ] The animation finishes seconds before the actual reloading This weapon was listed in the DevForum post for the Summer Update II , but it was not in-game until the following day. This is the signature weapon for the Paintballer, replacing the Mossberg 500 . The model of the weapon is modeled after ROBLOX's Brickbattle Paintball Gun. When the paintball gun is shot at a window, it will result in a paint splatter instead of the window shattering.

Contents 1 General Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History 8 Sources General Information [ ] This weapon performs similarly to the Windicator due to its behavior. However, it additionally makes tracer shots when fired. The Pathbringer holds 6 futuristic bullets with 24 ammo in reserve; these bullets create a Tracer Shot which is a problem because the Tracer Shot always gives away your position at far ranges. The Pathbringer's damage is the exact same as the Windicator's body and headshot damage with its fall-off . Its reload time is fast, and the fire-rate is also fast compared to the Windicator. However, the Pathbringer's reload time and the fire rate are a little slower than these Windicator's behaviors. Even though when the users spam with this weapon, the spread continues to lack with its fire-rate. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Fast rate of fire. Quick reload. Cons: Small 6-round magazine capacity. High spread upon continuous shots. Tracer shot can give away the user's position. Tips [ ] The most dominant trait of the Pathbringer is its terrible ccuracy. Only its first two shots are accurate enough to hit opponents from mid-range. This weapon is most effective at close-range where it can ramp-up its damage to one-shot opponents. Space out your shots to slow down the spread from getting too high. The Pathbringer will dominate against weaker Projectile weapons, but will lose against Shotguns and Automatics if you get too close. This weapon reloads fast, but not fast enough to survive an intense fight. Gallery [ ] Trivia [ ] The weapon was leaked in one of mightybaseplate's Twitch streams. &#91; 1 &#93; It is modeled after a fictional weapon created by Alex Andreu in 3dsmax . This, along with the Z80 , the BH10 and the Pulse Musket do not use the Evaporate kill effect by default.

It was made for the U.S. Government service revolver trials of 1872 by Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company (Colt Manufacturing Company), and was made the standard issue revolver for the U.S. Military until 1982. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The Peacemaker will always instant kill upon a shot to the head at any range, and will do a minimum of 45 damage even upon hitting a target's body at longer distances. Be mindful of its low ammo pool; as the Peacemaker is gate loaded, players will have to individually load every round. If all of its ammunition is expended, the impending reload will be punishingly slow. The Peacemaker shares a unique ability along with the Peppergun , being able to rapid-fire with the use of the right mouse button (RMB). In this state, the Peacemaker will rapidly fire off all six shots, albeit with a markedly increased spread penalty. It's best to use the fan-fire ability of this weapon in close range as the primary fire-rate of the weapon is relatively slow which makes it less suitable for close-quarters combat. It is also suggested to use the single-shot mode at longer ranges. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Fan-fire ability. 1-by-1 reloading allows topping off. Decent accuracy compared to other pistols on single shots. Fast rate of fire upon fan-firing. Cons: High spread penalty upon fan-firing. Slow primary rate of fire. Sluggish empty reload time for a revolver. High recoil when fan-firing. High ammo consumption when fan-firing. Tips [ ] The Peacemaker's most infamous trait is its recoil. This makes it hard to aim, especially during intense fights. Try to space out your shots. This will allow the recoil to wear off, giving you cleaner shots. The best strategy with the Peacemaker is to use its fan-fire ability at close-range, and fire single shots and mid-range. If you successfully fan-fire at an opponent but fail to kill them, reload one bullet and finish them off. Using single shots at close-range will make you quickly lose intense fights. If all else fails, try landing one shot on an opponent. A minimum of 45 damage is enough for a teammate to give you an assist. If you're coming to Arsenal as a Typical Colors 2 player, you might recognize that the Peacemaker is similar to the Quick Draw used by the Agent. However, take note: The Quick Draw's \"doubled fire-rate\" ability is manually used by the Peacemaker. Simply right-click to do so. Just like the Quick Draw, the Peacemaker's fan-fired shots are very inaccurate. Only use them at the correct time, which is at close-range. Gallery [ ] In third person. Peacemaker in real life. Trivia [ ] The Peacemaker is more accurately known as the Colt Single Action Army , a single-action revolver that holds six cartridges. Currently, it is still being sold and manufactured to this day as its 3rd iteration. Fan-firing/fanning is a shooting technique used with revolvers: a user holds down the trigger of their firearm, and rapidly hits the hammer repeatedly, allowing for the rapid-fire of single-action revolvers. It is the signature weapon of the Desperado, Handsome Hoss, Garbage Handler and Scrooge skins. The Peacemaker along with the Rocket Launcher , the Barrett , the G-17 , the AUG , the XR15 , the Trench Gun , and the DB Shotgun are the only primary weapons that appear in the Arcade gamemode. The name \"Peacemaker\" comes from the fact that it was used by law enforcement during the mid 19th century. This gun is used for getting the badge, \"The New Bebop\" which is to get a peacemaker kill with the Handsome Hoss Character. The model for this gun was used for the Quick Draw in Typical Colors 2 . The Quick Draw also functions the same as the Peacemaker, except its fan-fire ability only can be used after dealing enough damage (and fan-fired shots dealt more damage than normal).

It is a type of weapon used in the 1820s-40s, until the introduction of the more modern revolver design by Samuel Colt. There are many variants of the Pepperbox in real life, but the in-game model is either based on the Lefaucheux or the Victor Collete Pepperbox. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] Similar in the gameplay to the Peacemaker with its 6 shots, fan-fire ability, and gate-loading, the Peppergun seems to be a much more body shot oriented revolver. The Peppergun is also one of the most common revolvers in the game. Unlike the Peacemaker, the Peppergun cannot instantly kill with a headshot. However, the its fall-off allows it to deal more damage in closer ranges to the point where it can one-shot enemies if a player gets close enough. It is a guaranteed two-shot kill otherwise. Thanks to its gate-loading nature, the Peppergun shares a slow reload time with the Peacemaker , although it gives players the benefit of being able to reload as they fire. Right-clicking allows players to fan-fire, allowing the Peppergun to shoot in a pseudo fast way that surpasses the speed of its cousin, the Peacemaker. However this is quite dangerous, even more than it's counterpart, as it increases the Peppergun's spread quite significantly, and rapidly dispenses all 6 rounds from every barrel quickly. This can kill at closer ranges before opponents have time to react. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Will one-shot in extremely close quarters. Extremely fast fan-firing rate. 1-by-1 reloading allows topping off. Low spread upon primary firing. Cons: Only single-action revolver without a one-shot kill headshot ability at longer ranges. High spread penalty upon fan-firing. Low first-shot accuracy upon fan-firing. Magazine is easily expended upon fan-firing. Slow empty reload time. Slow primary rate of fire. Tips [ ] The Peppergun is a very questionable weapon. It can kill opponents in two shots, but its accuracy will make it very difficult to pull this off. Unlike the other Pistols, the Peppergun's accuracy limits its effective distance to only close-range. The Peppergun's fan-fire is very fast, taking only one second to shoot out all of its bullets. Use this when pouncing on an enemy so you can quickly kill them without getting hit. The first two shots are more accurate than the rest, and it deals enough damage to two-shot opponents. The best strategy to kill with the Peppergun is to fan-fire at an opponent from close-range. If you land several bullets but fail to kill your opponent, reload one bullet and primary-fire it to finish them off. This depends on your aim. Its accuracy when fan-firing gets very high. If you're not close enough to your target, most of your bullets will miss. An alternative way to finish an opponent off is to use hit them with your Knife , but only if your fan-fire hit them at least once. Gallery [ ] In third person. Peppergun in real life. Trivia [ ] Player characters in-game do not actually make any motions with their hand to cock the hammer after every shot, only raising it upwards and somehow managing to re-cock it. Due to control differences, mobile users could not fan-fire the gun before May 16, 2020. The audio of the Peppergun is commonly used in other ROBLOX games that feature guns.

The iron sights have been moved off-center to the user side of the weapon to prevent the bolt handle from obscuring the view. In-Game Information [ ] The Peppermint Rifle is somewhat similar to the M1A1 Carbine , having the same slow movement speed, along with bigger magazines and faster reload. However, the Peppermint Rifle is slightly weaker, with its damage range only being 24-70 damage. A headshot will still one-shot an opponent. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage to the head. Rather quick reload time. Low recoil. Fast fire rate. Cons: High spread. Slow movement speed. Takes 4 or 5 shots to kill a target at further ranges. Tips [ ] Unlike the other Marksman Rifles, the Peppermint Rifle is terrible at long-range. Even if you manage to land a shot, it will at deal 24 damage at the least. Headshots will still insta-kill from any distance, although this can be rather risky. The Peppermint Rifle excels at closer-ranged combat, especially with its ability to fire shots very quickly. At this distance, it will take 2-3 shots to get a kill. As with every Marksman Rifle, especially the Peppermint Rifle's spread gets higher the more you shoot. If you're fighting at mid-range, be mindful of this. While it does have a fast reload, it takes about 3 seconds to do so. This won't help during an intense fight with an opponent. Run and take cover while reloading, then jump back into the fight. This will guarantee your survival. Gallery [ ] Workshop submission with a non-event alternative for the model. Trivia [ ] The Walther M1918 Model I prototype submachine gun was the inspiration for the weapon model, although much of the mesh had to be improvised due to general lack of reference images for such an obscure weapon. Originally, the Peppermint Rifle was supposed to be called \" Pea Shooter \", had a green wooden stock and had a can of peas in place of the magazine. As the Arsenal Workshop re-opened for Christmas-themed submissions, the model was repurposed to meet the submission requirements. The original model was included in the same submission with the event version as a post-event alternative. The Peppermint Rifle's model was made by a Discord user and MAD STUDIO developer, nettimato, who also created the G11 , the Calico , the STEN , the TOZ-106 , the Dual Shotguns , the Focus and the Stake Launcher models. The Peppermint Rifle's old firing sound was taken from the M1A1 carbine in Day of Infamy, same with the M1A1 Carbine and M1A1 Paratrooper in-game.

This weapon can be used to throw pizza at enemies or to gain a temporary speed boost. The PIZZA deals little damage per hit; however, its ramp-up makes up for this, with a 2-hit kill at close ranges. It also has a very fast reload speed and fire rate. When right-clicking, the player will grab a pizza slice from the box and eat it, gaining a speed boost that only lasts for 10 seconds. This action consumes 1 ammo per use. The PIZZA has a pizza slice or \"magazine\" of 8 ammo with 40 reserved. When reloading, the user will throw the pizza box away and equip a new one. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Eating a pizza slice (by right-clicking) gives a 10 second speed boost. Extremely quick reload. Fast fire rate. Fall-off allows for high damage at extremely close ranges. Cons: Heavily affected by gravity. Low damage in mid and long ranges. High ammo consumption. No headshot multiplier. Small ammo capacity. Speed boost immediately stops upon kill or death. Tips [ ] The PIZZA's biggest strength is the speed boost. After eating a pizza slice, the user becomes twice as fast, the same speed as someone using the Golden Knife . Use the speed boost to get around faster, especially if the current map is large in size. The speed boost also makes you hard to hit. Move more unpredictably to make the most of this. Getting a backstab with your Knife becomes a lot easier while under a speed boost. Make sure to aim higher than you normally would when using the PIZZA. Being a projectile weapon, the slices are heavily affected by gravity. The PIZZA has rewarding ramped-up damage, but has very weak fall-off damage, too. Try to confront enemies at close-range to quickly get a kill with this weapon. If you eat a pizza slice for that speed boost, you can quickly approach enemies to ramp-up your damage. Trivia [ ] This is the only weapon with the special ability to grant a player with a speed boost, faster than using a melee. When inspecting the PIZZA, there are only 5 pizzas in the box instead of the 8 pizzas implied by the magazine size. While inspecting the PIZZA and using its ability, it makes an old ROBLOX sound \" Pizza! \", which came from the pizza gear . The pizza box is a reference to Builder Brothers Pizza , the fictional company in Work at a Pizza Place . It is the signature weapon of the Pizza Boy skin. The pizza also appears in Arsenal Archived as a heal pack.

The Plasma Launcher fires a burst of three plasma balls, each of which explode on contact with a surface, dealing damage in a huge splash radius. Like many explosive weapons, it is possible to rocket jump with the Plasma Launcher, but this will lead to some self-damage. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Infinite ammo. Burst fires quickly. High damage. Cons: Long burst delay between each burst-fire. Poor blast radius compared to other explosive weapons. No one-shot capability for an explosive weapon. Users can easily kill themselves in close quarters if not careful. Slow travel speed, very easy to dodge it. Trivia [ ] When the July 4th update first released, the Plasma Launcher used to fire 20 damage pellets at a faster rate, similar to the Slingshot but without a projectile arch and was able to rocket jump. This weapon along with the R800 , the Spellbook and the Z80 are the only non-Brickbattle weapons in Arsenal that have an infinite magazine and ammo. This is the only explosive weapon that doesn't launch players. This and the M16A2 are the only 3-round burst weapons in the game. The Plasma Launcher is the only weapon with two kill effects when killing a player. Those are Evaporate and Gib. The Scientist and Professor skins have this as their signature weapon. The weapon has a noticeably slower movement speed than the knife, despite the fact that the majority of the weapon is floating, while the only thing touching the user is the wristwatch controlling the plasma-arcs. Weapon History [ ] 07/05/19: Added into the July Update of Arsenal Later changed firing mode from single shots to burst. 07/06/19: Removed the ability to rocket jump . 01/04/20: The Plasma Launcher is properly colored on the menu now in the 3.3.2 Update . 05/16/20: Lightened the glowing parts of the fingers and watch. 10/25/20: Re-added the ability to rocket jump. 11/01/21: Removed from Clown Infection . v • t • e Pistols (28) Classic Pistol - Deagle - Dual Volcanics - Falkor - Five-SeveN - G-18 - G-19X - G-21 - Golden Gun - Golden Hush Puppy - Handcannon - Hi-Power - Hush Puppy - Kolibri - Literal Gun - Little Tom - Luger - M1911 - M9 - Makarov - Maxim-9 - Minifigure - Origami Gun - P250 - PRISMAS - Soul Pistol - TEC-9 - USP Revolvers (8) Classic Revolver - Dual LCRs - Electric Revolver - Pathbringer - Peacemaker - Peppergun - Python - Webley - Windicator SMGs (25) Classic P90 - Classic SMG - BH10 - FMG-9 - Grease Gun - MAC-10 - MAT-49 - MP5 - MP5K - MP5-SD - MP7 - MP9-S - Mauser Carbine - Micro Uzis - Model 635 - P90 - PP-Bizon - PPSH - STEN - Tommy Gun - UMP-45 - Uzi - Vector - War Group Relic - Z80 Shotguns (19) AA12 - Blunderbuss - Calico - Classic Shotgun - DB Shotgun - Dual Shotguns - Inertial Shotgun - Lever Shotgun - MAG-7 - Mossberg 500 - Nutcracker - Pump Shotgun - R800 - Saiga-12 - SPAS 12 - TOZ-106 - Tavor - Trench Gun - XM1014 Automatic Rifles (30) Armament - AR-PDW - AK47 - AK74 - AKM - AUG - BAR - Classic AUG - Classic Rifle - FAMAS - FN FAL - Focus - G11 - G3 - G36 - Galil - L86A3 - Laser Rifle - M14 EBR - M16A1 - M16A2 - M4A1 - MK18 - Nailgun - Potassium Power - Pulse Laser - SCAR-H - SCAR-L - SG550 - XR15 Marksman Rifles (11) ABS Rifle - Dragunov - Henry Rifle - M1 Garand - M14 - M1A1 Carbine - M1A1 Paratrooper - Peppermint Rifle - SKS - Spencer Carbine - Springfield Rifle Machine Guns (11) Candy Cane Miniguns - Classic Gatling - DB Chauchat - EM249 - Gatling Gun - M1919A6 Machine Gun - M249 - M60 - MG36 - MG42 - Minigun Sniper Rifles (13) AWP - Barrett - Classic Sniper - DBS - G3SG1 - Golden Musket - M40 - MS556 - Mosin-Nagant - Musket - Pulse Musket - Railgun - Sako 85 Specials (44) Acid Spitter - Arm Cannon - Autobow - Bomb - Baseball Launcher - Bow - Chord Tosser - Classic Crossbow - Classic Paintball Gun - Classic RPG - Classic Slingshot - Concussion Rifle - Cone Launcher - Crossbow - Dispenser - Explosive Barrel - Firework Launcher - Flamethrower - Golden Bomb - Golden Bow - Ice Stars - Kritzkrieg - Lightning Cannon - M79 - MGL - Ornament - PIZZA - Paintball Gun - Plasma Launcher - Pocket Potassium - Presents - Razor Bomb - Rocket Launcher - RPG - Slingshot - Snowball - Spellbook - Stake Launcher - Sunflower Sun - Superball - TP Launcher - Trash Can - Trowel - Ultraball - Water Balloon Melees (11) Firebrand - Darkheart - Golden Knife - Ghostwalker - Ice Dagger - Illumina - Knife - Squeaky Hammer - Sword - Venomshank - Windforce Exclusives (8) Admin Launcher - Bomb-Blaster - Fasticuffs - Golden Creagle - Influencer Launcher - OddBall - The Bomb - Very Long Bat Removed (19) C14 Timberwolf - CZ75-Auto - Creagle - Dual Berettas - Flaming Pumpkin - HE Grenade - M1917 - M24 - M4A1-S - M4A4 - MP9 - Negev - Nova - RJL BREACH - SCAR-20 - SVD - Sawed-Off - TOZ-34 - USP-S Miscellaneous (9) Battle Axe - Cannonball - FP-45 - Poison Potion - Rocket Jumper - Scout - Soul Rifle - Union Pistol - Zeus x27",

Its explosion is a yellow banana color In-game Information [ ] In-game, its ability to one-shot kill upon a splash or a direct hit makes it easy to kill enemies. However, it only carries one round in a magazine. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: One-shot kill upon a splash or direct hit. Capable of rocket jumping . Explosive area-of-effect capability allows for multiple kills. Cons: Only carries one round. Moderately slow reload. Slow projectile speed, so timing is key. Somewhat high self-damage upon rocket jumping. Users can easily kill themselves if not careful. Tips [ ] The Pocket Potassium is naturally deadly to foes, but only with the right strategy. Because of its tiny magazine size and slow reload, missing a shot will allow opponents to capitalize. The best strategy with the Pocket Potassium is to blast jump with it and land on a high platform on the current map. Then, once it's reloaded, you can fire at opponents on the ground below. The reload is not fast enough to shoot in mid-air, so it's important to find a high platform after blast jumping. If possible, try killing two or more opponents that are close together so you can promote to the next weapon multiple times. Gallery [ ] Early Development. Trivia [ ] Pocket Potassium was revealed in the Arsenal Discord . The Pocket Potassium was listed as Banana Gun in the DevForum for the Summer Update II . This along with the RPG , the Bow , the Musket , the M16A2 's grenade launcher, the M79 and the Golden Gun are the only weapons in the game to carry a single round. The Pocket Potassium acts similar to the Banana Gun from the Super Smash Bros. series. The Pocket Potassium is one of the joke weapons along with the Literal Gun , the TP Launcher , the Potassium Power , the Origami Gun , the Dispenser , and the Very Long Bat .

It reloads from a literal banana magazine, which can be clearly seen upon inspecting the weapon. In-game Information [ ] The Potassium Power is much more different compared to its AK cousins: It fires at a greater speed, does less damage per shot, and has a halved magazine size of 15 rounds, the lowest in its class. As long as players can deal with its low magazine size, the weapon can easily kill enemies within close range and is capable of longer-range fire when burst-firing it. Intrinsic due to the weapon's high rate of fire and small magazine, the Potassium Power will need to be reloaded if the players are unable to kill an opponent with their first. Reloads can be a detriment and potentially lead to death, as the reload speed is rather slow in comparison to other weapons of such magazine size and fire rate. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Quick rate of fire. Quick TTK (time to kill) in close quarters. Good damage for its class. Fairly fast reload. Cons: Low magazine size. Severe recoil upon continuous firing. High spread penalty upon continuous firing. High ammo consumption. Tips [ ] The Potassium Power's biggest weakness is its low magazine size. During the middle of a fight, it can run out of ammo at the worst time. To play it safe and secure the kill, only use this weapon at close-range. At this distance, your damage is maxed out through ramp-up, and more shots are likely to land. If you're stuck at mid-range and unable to approach closer, try burst-firing instead. Only shoot a few bullets at a time and then stop for a second. This will keep your accuracy, even from a distance. Your best strategy with the Potassium Power is ambushing. If you can jump off a higher platform while shooting at an unsuspecting enemy below, you can secure the kill quickly. This also works if you can predict when an opponent will turn around a corner. Gallery [ ] Potassium Power in real life as the AK. Trivia [ ] The Potassium Power is an AK that's both gold-plated and uses a banana magazine. It's a play on the AK-style curved magazines, often affectionately referred to as a banana mag. The weapon is based on hyper's literally a banana mag video. The magazine of Potassium Power is also based off the dancing banana from the Peanut Butter Jelly Time song. The reason why Potassium Power uses a banana magazine is because potassium is a nutrient found commonly in foods such as banana but more in the avocado.

It was built for police and counter-terrorist usage, and came into service in 1996. It features a prominent, 64-round helical magazine placed below the barrel, which offers a surprisingly high amount of rounds to be used in a very compact package. In-game Information [ ] Current Archived In-game, the PP-Bizon's fast rate of fire ensures that enemies will be shredded in a matter of seconds. The low spread and recoil helps with finishing users at longer ranges. The high ammo capacity helps with saving users time without reloading. However, the PP-Bizon has a long reload time, meaning if players run out of ammo, they would have to suffer long periods of time. The low damage can also be a pain at a whopping 8, although going closer and the fast rate of fire makes up for it. The PP-Bizon was in the archived version of Arsenal before it was eventually removed later around late 2017. It had a high ammo compacity but low damage and high spread. This wasn't really shamed though, and it was relatively easy to get off of. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High ammo capacity of 64. Low spread. Fast rate of fire. Good damage in close quarters. Has no recoil. Cons: Long reload time of 4 seconds. Very low minimum damage of 8 on the body and 12 on the head. Tips [ ] The PP-Bizon is a tricky weapon to use. It has a large magazine size and fast firing speed, but each bullet deals very small damage. This is why it is especially important to aim for the head, as headshots deal respectable damage. You can ramp-up the PP-Bizon's damage and kill enemies quicker by fighting at close-range. Try using the Knife to close the distance, and then switch back to the PP-Bizon. The PP-Bizon has one of the longest reloads among the SMGs, so it's important to get a kill within the first magazine. The slow reload leaves you as an easy target to your opponents, so be careful. Gallery [ ] Inspect PP-Bizon in real life. Trivia [ ] This weapon used to be in a deleted ROLVe game called Counter Blox: Roblox Offensive , but in Counter Blox , This weapon was supposed to be added in the game, but was replaced by the Thompson (or Tommy Gun). The PP-Bizon shares the same ammo with the Makarov , the 9x18mm Makarov round. The PP-Bizon shares 60% of the parts from AK-74 . The PP-Bizon's magazine, often mistaken for a grenade launcher, is made from a durable glass-reinforced polyamide and mounts under the handguard in line with the barrel, which makes the weapon more compact and concealable. All cartridges are aligned nose forward in the Bizon magazine and cannot be loaded incorrectly. The magazine and grip colour fragment resembles the Bullfrog Gun in Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War .

It feeds from a 71-round drum magazine and fires a 7.62x25mm Tokarev pistol round. In-Game Information [ ] The PPSH was added in the game on as part of the September Update . When it was first released, the PPSH had pistol inspect animations, a magazine of only 30, the MAC-10 in the viewport model, and had the firing sound of the Uzi and the MAC . It also had no reloading sound along with very high spread. It wasn't shown in the 2.9.9 update log and was removed the next day due to it being unfinished and messy. After some fixes, the PPSH was re-added in the first Halloween Update to the praise of the community. The PPSH functions similar to the Tommy Gun , with both guns having high magazine capacity and low minimum damage. However, unlike the Tommy Gun, it has low spread. Because of the high fire-rate and low spread, it is useful at almost all ranges. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High maximum damage. Fast rate of fire. Fast reload. Largest magazine size in-class. Fairly low spread. Highest total ammo in-class. Cons: Low minimum damage. Trivia [ ] It's the third weapon in Arsenal to fire from a drum magazine. The PPSH is commonly known as the \" papasha \", a Russian word meaning \" daddy .\" Its formal name is the \" pistolet-pulemyot Shpagina \", transcribed in English as the Shpagin machine pistol . This gun was designed by Georgy Shpagin in 1941, and is still present in countries such as Syria and Albania. The PPSH was more commonly used with stick magazines rather than the more iconic drum magazine, as the manufacturing meant drum magazines were not interchangeable. Stick magazines proved both easier to reload and cheaper/easier to manufacture, and as such they superseded the drum magazines. When it was first released, the PPSH used to have the pistols ' inspect and reload animations. Gallery [ ] Weapon development. Render of the upcoming PPSH model. PPSH in real life.

The magazines, hammers, triggers, and barrels are connected together (although they are still separate) to allow the weapon to fire both barrels with one trigger pull. It can be chambered in both .45 ACP and .38 Super. They were created to celebrate the 100-year anniversary of the M1911s. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Trivia 5 Gallery 6 Audio (Outdated) 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] In-game, this weapon can be tap fired. This deals 27 damage at the end of its damage-drop off, and deals high damage at close ranges. However, when this is fired repeatedly, the spread increases. The PRISMAS has a high 16 magazine with 8 cartridges in each gun and it has a decent reload, unlike the Dual Volcanics which has a lengthy 1-by-1 reload. However, with a low damage of 27, it gives players who put in the effort of headshotting. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High Headshot damage. Fast rate of fire. Big magazine size. Relatively low spread. Cons: Low damage at long ranges. Moderately slow reload. Tips [ ] The PRISMAS are practically easy to get a kill with, due to its good damage and fast firing rate. It especially dominates at intense fights because of its ramped-up damage is powerful enough to quickly two-shot opponents at close-range. The PRISMAS are less effective at long range, but are still viable due to its low spread. It can reload fast, but it's slower than most of the other Pistols in the game (because there's two guns to reload). Make sure you're not in the middle of an intense fight while reloading! Trivia [ ] This is one of the weapons that are dual-wielded. The others are the Dual Volcanics , the Micro Uzis , the Dual Shotguns , and the Dual LCRs . In the Starter Pack icon, The One skin can be seen holding the PRISMAS. And its also his signature weapon. The PRISMAS and the Dual Volcanics make the same firing sound, although the PRISMAS does not have the lever-action cocking sound. Gallery [ ] PRISMAS in real life.

As such, the Pulse Laser is a fictional weapon. In-game Information [ ] The Pulse Laser has extremely low damage, but its extremely fast fire-rate somewhat makes up for this. The Pulse Laser has the fastest fire-rate in the game. It also has no spread and no recoil. Despite the Pulse Laser having the fastest fire-rate of all weapons in Arsenal , it has two major drawbacks. One is its very low damage, and even if a player lands their hits, enemies may have the chance to kill them first because of its severely low damage. Second of all, the Pulse Laser has a lengthy reload, causing players to suffer if they do not kill their opponents quickly. Combined with the fast fire-rate, the magazine is easily expended and players will have to suffer from lengthy reloads. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Very fast fire-rate. Has no spread and recoil. Above-average magazine size for its class. Decent reload time Cons: High ammo consumption rate. Tracer shot can give away the user's position. Can cause lag when spammed due to Tracer Shot. Low damage per shot. Slow movement speed for its class. Magazine size is easily expended due to its fire rate. Tips [ ] The Pulse Laser is very deadly, as it fires very quickly and accurately. However, its low damage and slow reload will make you a sitting duck if you miss your shots. The Pulse Laser's reload speed is 2.5 seconds, too slow to let you reload in an intense fight without dying. You may be able to kill opponents fast, but missing a few shots won't secure you the kill. It's especially important to keep your aim steady with the Laser Rifle. Stay at mid-range as much as possible, as this is your most advantageous distance against opponents. The Pulse Laser can potentially snipe someone from long-range, you're more likely to miss if you don't keep your aim constant on your target. At close-range it's even worse, as you'll have to track your opponent if they start hopping around you, which will waste a huge amount of ammo. At mid-range, you can easily aim at your target without moving your aim too much. The Pulse Laser has very noticeable tracer shots, so beware of any players using them to find your location. Gallery [ ] Pulse Laser as a Nerf gun. Trivia [ ] Despite the weapon appearing to have two barrels that can fire lasers, only the top barrel is usable. The weapon is reloaded from two power cells loaded into the back of the weapon, which appears to have some sort of energy source within. In a different case, though, the Nerf gun version of the Pulse Laser appears to have a magazine as a reload function, unlike its original function in the game. Pulse Laser has the fastest fire-rate in the game, surpassing both the Micro Uzis and Nailgun . The Pulse Laser shared the same reloading as the DBS , DB Shotgun and Lever Shotgun . However, all the sounds mentioned above have different pitches. The weapon model is based on the Soviet DP-64 45mm handheld Grenade launcher designed in 1989. The only differences are the material of the barrels and the detachable double uranium cores. Similarly, the Baseball Launcher is also based on a Soviet weapon, the TKB-0249 grenade launcher. The Pulse Laser is the signature weapon of GOC Future, R01-V3, Trooper and Dart Warrior skins . This weapon is the only weapon used in the Dundertale quest. This, the Focus , the Handcannon , the Laser Rifle , the R800 , and the Railgun are the only weapons that use the Evaporate kill effect regardless of what kill effect the player has equipped. The Pulse Laser was originally called the Laser Rifle . On April 13, 2021, toy company Hasbro has announced their official partnership with ROBLOX and released a Nerf blaster based on the Pulse Laser. The package contains a code that could be used to give out a back accessory item called, Arsenal: Pulse Laser . The Pulse Laser makes an appearance in the RPG Event as the weapon used by the Air Unit enemy.

It is a futuristic variation of the original Musket , being similar to it due to it's damage, but the Pulse Musket has the quickest reload time and can hold 3 bullets in a magazine. It is considerably the futuristic weapon with the highest damage dealt which is 300 (body-shot) and 375 (headshot). Plus, it has an accessible sight to aim at the opponent at long ranges which makes it easier to kill. The Pulse Musket's weaknesses are the slow rate of fire; in which players will have to wait a somewhat long time to fire again, and the Tracer Shot may give away it's position. It also has a unique reload where a mechanical arm on the side of the weapon grabs directly from the ammo reserve and loads it into the barrel. Contents 1 Pros &amp; Cons 2 Tips 3 Gallery 4 Trivia 5 Audio 6 Weapon History Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Quick reload. One shot kill for both bodyshots and headshots. Accessible sight allows for far ranges kills, upon a right-click. No spread and recoil. Cons: Slow rate of fire. Tracer shot can give away shooter's location. Very low mag size. Tips [ ] The Pulse Musket is effective from any distance, as it deals a flat damage of 300, no matter how far you shoot from. It is recommended that you only scope in if shooting from long-range, and shoot without scoping within close- or mid-range. The Pulse Musket's fast reload will help you during intense fights, as you only need one shot loaded in to get a kill. The Pulse Musket wins against Pistols, SMGs, and Automatic Rifles. However, it rivals other Sniper Rifles, Shotguns, Marksman Rifles, and some SMGs. It depends on who lands their shot first. Gallery [ ] ADS (Blue). ADS (Red). ADS (Yellow). ADS (Green). Sketch.

Trivia [ ] The Pulse Musket was revealed in the Arsenal Discord on July 29th, 2020. The Pulse Musket's reload animation is based on the AR2 rifle and the Pulse SMG from the Half Life franchise. The Pulse Musket is one of the weapons that has access to ADS. The others are the MK18 , the Falkor , the DBS , the Vector , the M14 EBR , and the DB Chauchat .

In-game Information [ ] The Pump Shotgun's average damage per pellet allows for a quick kill at point-blank range. It also shares a one-by-one reload alongside other shotguns, granting the user the ability to fire the weapon whilst reloading. The Pump Shotgun's middling spread and slow rate of fire makes taking an enemy at range a chore. The weapon's minute ammunition capacity and sluggish reload speed makes it essential to only focus a single target. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Above average damage per pellet. One-by-one reloading allows topping off within a conflict. Cons: Slow empty reload cycle. Slow reload cycle. Slow rate of fire. Low ammo capacity. High pellet spread. Tips [ ] The Pump Shotgun's most noticeable con is its high pellet spread. Unlike most of the other Shotgun-class weapons, this means you would need to get closer to enemies than fighting at mid-range. Try not to shoot at opponents who are on a higher or lower platform than you. The Pump Shotgun will be easier to get a kill with if you fight someone on the same height level. If you're coming to Arsenal as a Typical Colors 2 player, use the Pump Shotgun exactly as you would the stock Shotgun from TC2, as they have the exact same stats. Do beware that the Pump Shotgun's bullet spread is slightly worse than in TC2 , so you will need to find ways to compensate. Trivia [ ] A pump-action shotgun is a class of shotguns that are distinguished in the way in which spent shells are extracted and fresh ones are chambered. A pump-action or slide-action firearm is one in which a forend can be moved forward and backward in order to eject a spent round of ammunition and to chamber a fresh one. The first slide-action patent was issued to Alexander Bain of Britain in 1854. The weapon was mistakenly referred to as the Trench Gun in the DevForum post for the 2.3 Update . The Pump Shotgun's model, animations, and (formerly) sound effects are all ported straight from Typical Colors 2 , where it is used by the Trooper , Arsonist , Brute , and Mechanic classes. This is one of the few guns that uses a generic name opposed to the actual weapon's name.

It was first introduced in 1955, the same year as Smith &amp; Wesson's M29 .44 Magnum . The Colt Python is intended for the premium revolver market segment. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Trivia 5 Audio 6 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The Python is a fully black colored firearm. As with every revolver in Arsenal , it stores 6 bullets at a time and has an ammo reserve of 24. It also deals hefty damage, insta-killing opponents if nearby or upon headshot. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. No spread. Minimal recoil. One-shot on the head and close ranges. Cons: Small 6-round magazine size. Slow firing rate. Somewhat long reload. Tips [ ] Because of its perfect accuracy, the Python is great from long-range, where it will be easy for you to get kills, but harder for your targets to fight back. However, from long-range, you will need two carefully placed shots to get a kill, due to the weak fall-off damage. The Python is also a monster at intense fights, as landing a shot on the head or if the opponent is near is an instant kill. Be sure to get that kill before running out of bullets, because the Python's reload speed leaves you wide open in intense fights. Trivia [ ] Before being added as a weapon, a silhouette of the Python appeared in the voting icon for the Wild West gamemode . The speedloader is still visible on the player's arm if they turn their FOV to 110 or above on settings. This weapon shares this issue with the Pathbringer . This reuses the Electric Revolver 's animations. You can also see that the \"spent rounds\" inside of the Python's cylinder still have bullets inside them whilst reloading it. This issue is also present on the Webley 's reload as well. This weapon uses the same model as the Python in MURDER , just untextured.

It works similarly to the Pump Shotgun ; which has high spread, but high damage to make up for it. This gun destroys enemies in close range, so players should try to get in as close as possible when using this weapon. In longer ranges, this weapon struggles due to the extremely wide pellet spread, but lasers will still hit if aimed at the enemy's general direction, dealing 10 damage per hit, which is somewhat more than other shotguns. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High pellet damage. Infinite ammo and magazine. No reloading required. Cons: Tracer shot can give away the user's position. Can cause lag when spammed due to tracer shot. Low minimum damage per pellet. Widest pellet spread in-class. Tips [ ] The R800's infinite ammo will give you an edge over opponents in the midst of an intense fight, as you it never has to stop to reload. Even with its fast firing-rate, it's best to not spam too much. The tracer shots given from the R800's pellets will obscure your vision, even if for only a second. Spacing out your shots will allow you to miss less shots and track where your opponents are on your screen. Beware of the R800's wide spread, as it is almost useless at mid-range. You will have to be near opponents in order to deal serious damage. The easiest way to do this is to turn corners and immediately fire, where hopefully an opponent will be located. If you're coming to Arsenal as a Typical Colors 2 player, the R800 may look like Mechanic's Einsteinium that you're familiar with, but they function very differently. The Einsteinium fires a single shot that can hit enemies from any range. However , the R800 fires multiple pellets and has limited range. You will need to switch up your usual tactics when using this weapon. The R800 also does not give afterburn to targets, so your aim alone is the only way to get kills. Trivia [ ] The previous firing sound for the R800 came from the Widowmaker , a primary weapon choice for the Engineer from Team Fortress 2 . The R800 shares its model with a Typical Colors 2 weapon named the Einsteinium , a primary weapon used by the Mechanic class. This weapon, along with the Plasma Launcher , the Spellbook , the Z80 , and the Paintball Gun are the only non-Brickbattle weapons in Arsenal that have an infinite ammo pool. The R800 makes an appearance in the RPG Event as a weapon used by the \"Enforcer Unit\" enemy. However, the weapon acted more like the Einsteinium weapon from Typical Colors 2 , as it had the ability to deal afterburn damage to Heroes.

It will always instantly kill an enemy no matter where they are hit on the body, as it deals 100 body damage (280 on headshot). Another reason why this weapon is powerful because it is capable of shooting through enemies, granting the possibility for a collateral kill if enemies are lined up. Collateral kills are no different from the normal killing icon in the kill feed. The weapon cannot be reloaded and fires from a pool of 6 rounds, which can be refilled using ammo packs. The Railgun in the Mega Update is very similar to the Musket , in the fact that it is a one shot kill, it still used to shoot through players, holds a magazine capacity of 1, and has a very long reload after the users fired. It has an ammo reserve of 10. However, there is a key difference: it had one of the slowest movement speeds in the game. This means that the users have to hold their knife as a strategy to get anywhere on the map. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros One-shot to any part of the body across all ranges. Shoots through enemies allowing it to be able to kill multiple people at once. No reloading required. Scope allows for better magnification. Fast rate of fire for its class. Has no spread or recoil. Cons Tracer shot can give away the user's position. Low ammo pool. Sluggish movement speed. Tips [ ] The Railgun is a very good teaching tool to improve your reaction time. Since any shot that lands is an instant kill, you simply would need to keep an eye out for enemies and quickly aim in their direction. In Railgun Royale , your reaction time is put to the test, as a single missed shot or being in the wrong place is an instant death. Since the Railgun can be used from any distance, most of the time there's no need to scope in to see targets better. Only use it if your target is hard to see, such as if you are sniping someone from across the map. Beware that missing all six shots will make you lose access to the Railgun. In case it happens, consider working on your melee combat with your Knife , or your movement so you can grab nearby ammo boxes without getting hit. Trivia [ ] The Railgun is the sole weapon in the gamemode, Railgun Royale . A railgun uses electromagnetic force to launch a projectile at high speeds, using a pair of parallel conductors called \"rails\" on with a projectile accelerates along. This gives its name, the “Railgun”. Currently, they are only at the research stage and not seen in any handheld or military applications. The Railgun is the third semi-auto sniper in Arsenal with the Barrett and the G3SG1 . The Railgun is the signature weapon of the Digital Warrior skin. The Evaporate kill effect is used when a player is killed by the Railgun. The firing sound of the Railgun comes from the movie, Iron Man in 2008 during the Suit Up Scene. The previous model was taken from a ROBLOX gear called Halloween Ray Gun but with different textures. In rehaul, Railgun used to have a sound effect if shot through players. Railgun's damage was changed from 114 damage to 280 damage and then to 300 damage when hit headshot.

It is thrown in a forward motion, similar to how Batman throws his own Batarangs. In-game Information [ ] The player can throw this weapon at their enemies. When the razor bomb comes into contact with something, it will explode, dealing at least 89 damage to any player in its blast radius, with a 100% chance of a kill on a direct hit and at close ranges. With its superior damage and the absence of reloading, the razor bomb makes finishing off damaged players relatively easy. However, being one of the slowest projectile speeds in the game, the Razor Bomb can prove to be difficult to land a hit on far-away targets. This issue is further exacerbated by its slow fire rate, firing at a speed similar to the M40 . From long-ranges, splash damage hits will not one-shot the player and will make it harder to land a second hit since the first hit launches the enemy. As a result, long-range sniping with the Razor Bomb is not very effective, and due to its severely high damage, close-quarters fighting can easily result in suicide. Players can rocket-jump with this weapon, which deals 11 self-damage, the third-lowest in the game, behind the Lightning Cannon at 1/2 self-damage and the Concussion Rifle at 1/2 self-damage. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Can send players off the maps or into hazards using its blast force. No reloading required. Good ammo pool. Ability to Rocket Jump . Rocket Jumping only deals 11 self-damage. Cons: Users can easily kill or severely damage themselves if not careful. Slow projectile speed, so timing is key. Slow fire rate. The first splash hit will launch the enemy, making it harder to land the second hit to kill another player. Gallery [ ] Distorted model of the weapon. Trivia [ ] Razor Bomb was revealed in the Arsenal Discord on October 15, 2019. The Razor Bomb is NOT in randomizer contrary to popular belief. It got removed from it The Blade is likely based on the Razor Bats that Harry Osborn used in Spider-Man 3 . Sometimes in 3rd person view from another player, the player holding the Razor Bomb holds it incorrectly.

Instead of shells, the pellets are stored in a drum magazine. Contents 1 General Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Trivia 5 Weapon History General Information [ ] The RJL Breach is a futuristic, shotgun released in the Galactic Assault Update of Arsenal . This weapon has a faster fire-rate compared to some of the weapons of its sort possibly due to it not being able to one-shot at close range, unlike most other shotguns. This weapon also has a high magazine capacity due to the use of a drum magazine. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High headshot damage, even in long ranges. High ammo count for a shotgun to compensate for the low damage. Faster fire rate to compensate for the low damage. Cons: Low damage. High spread upon continous firing. Tips [ ] The RJL Breach's may have a huge magazine size and fast firing rate, but beware that its pellet spread gets higher with each shot. In 7-10 shots, the spread becomes too high to be effective at mid-range. The reload is moderately fast, but not fast enough to help you in an intense fight. This weapon can potentially be used for chip damage by hitting enemies from long-range. However, you will not do respectable damage. If this is your strategy, you will have to hope that your target gets killed by a teammate, crediting you with an assist. The RJL Breach is practically an alternate version of the AA12 , where it deals slightly more damage in turn for the high pellet spread. Trivia [ ] The RJL Breach is mistakenly named RLJ Breach and RGL Breach in the DevForum post of Galactic Assault Update and the promotional material for it on Twitter.

The rockets do both splash and direct damage; 130 directly and 97 damage with splash damage. This is one of the five weapons that allow players to rocket jump , dealing 22 self-damage per jump. If players do not jump before firing this weapon at their feet, they will likely explode themselves. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Ability to rocket jump . 1-by-1 reloading allows topping off. One-shot kill on direct hits. High splash damage. Cons: Long empty reload time. Users can easily kill themselves if not careful. Slow rate of fire. Slow projectile speed. Tips [ ] The Rocket Launcher is one of the most versatile weapons in the game, as it grants you both increased movement through rocket jumping, splash damage, and incredible power. The splash damage effect allows you to hit multiple opponents with one rocket. Successfully killing a group of opponents that are grouped up together will make you promote to the next weapon multiple times. This will let you make a huge gap between you and the other players on the scoreboard. A rocket deals 97 damage if it's not a direct hit. This will make it easy for a teammate to give you an assist, or even finish off weakened opponents with a single hit from your Knife . Remember that rocket jumping deals self-damage to you, which will make it easier for opponents to kill you while you're flying through the air. Rocket-jump damage alone, you can only do 4 rocket-jumps before you accidentally blow yourself up with a 5th rocket. If you blow yourself up, you get demoted. Be careful. If you're coming to Arsenal as a Typical Colors 2 player, you should note that you don't need to crouch before rocket jumping. Simply jump then shoot a rocket below you to do a rocket jump. If you try to crouch before rocket jumping, you will not go flying. Trivia [ ] The Rocket Launcher's model was taken directly from Typical Colors 2 , found in-game as the Trooper's primary weapon of choice. The model itself is based on the Rocket Launcher used by the Soldier from Team Fortress 2 as his primary weapon. Typical Colors 2's Rocket Launcher also only lets The Trooper rocket-jump 4 times before he blows himself up with a 5th. This is the signature weapon of Smiles, Soldier, and The Trooper. The design of this weapon looks to be part-M72 LAW, and part-RPG-7 with flipped grips. When the 3.3.15 update first dropped, the Rocket Launcher's overall damage was buffed. However, the buff was later shadow reverted in the Showtime! Update . The Rocket Launcher along with the Trench Gun , the Peacemaker , the AUG , the XR15 , the DB Shotgun , the Barrett , and the G-17 are the only weapons in the Arcade gamemode.

Regardless, it can kill anyone in its blast radius with one hit, direct or splash damage. It only holds one rocket but has infinite ammo capacity. It is also possible to rocket jump with the RPG, which has a high rocket jump travel range. It deals no self-damage when rocket jumping. Though the RPG does a great deal of damage even not on direct contact, it comes with an ordeal: the reload time takes three seconds. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros One-shot kill upon direct and splash contact. Explosive area of effect capability allows for multi-kills with one shot. Ability to rocket jump. No self-damage when rocket jumping. Large area of effect range. Infinite ammo. Cons Long reload time. Holds only one shot. Slow projectile speed. Tips [ ] Because the RPG only has a magazine size of one rocket and an incredibly slow reload, be very careful on where you aim or rocket jump to. The RPG's rockets have a bigger splash damage-hitbox and instantly kills opponents caught in the explosion. If you can fire a rocket at a group of opponents, you'll promote to the next weapon multiple times. If done correctly, the RPG's rocket jump can send you flying very quickly around the map compared to other weapons that can rocket jump Trivia [ ] The term \"Rocket Propelled Grenade\" was actually from the Russian language РПГ or ручной противотанковый гранатомёт (transliterated as \"ruchnoy protivotankovy granatomyot\" ), meaning \"hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher\". The RPG's model is most likely inspired by the RPG-18 or the RPG-26 . This is the signature weapon of the Brickbattle, BuffBattle and Buff BrickBattle skins. The RPG was one of the weapons that were in Brickbattle , with the others being the Bomb , the Superball , the Slingshot , and the Trowel . The RPG along with the Pocket Potassium , the Bow , the Musket , the M16A2 's grenade launcher, the M79 and the Golden Gun are the only weapons in the game to carry a single round. The RPG previously had a 12 ammo capacity before being reverted to have infinite ammo. Since then, a singular \"1\" appears on the ammo section in-game rather than being empty like the rest of the weapons.

This weapon was added as a replacement of the RJL Breach . Contents 1 General Information 1.1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Trivia 5 Weapon History General Information [ ] The Saiga‑12 is a Russian-designed semi-automatic (and in some variants, fully automatic) shotgun developed in the 1990s by Kalashnikov Concern (formerly Izhmash). It uses a long-stroke gas-piston system with a rotating bolt based on the AK‑47 design, feeding from detachable box or drum magazines, and supports various gauges including 12, 20, and .410 bore. In-Game Information [ ] The Saiga-12 is practically a weaker version of the AA12 . It can hold a lot of ammo and shoots quickly, however its damage makes it one of the more weaker Shotguns in the game. Another thing to note is that its damage range has neither fall-off nor ramp-up, so it deals the same amount of damage from any distance, making both safe and risky plays both viable. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Bigger magazine. Deals flat damage, no fall-off. Reloads all of its shots at once. Initial shots have tight spread. Fast firing rate. Cons: Low bodyshot damage. Spread gets higher with consecutive shots. Tips [ ] The Saiga-12 is a special case compared to the other Shotguns, and that's due to having neither fall-off nor ramped-up damage. This means that no matter how far you are from a target, you deal the exact same amount of damage. You can shoot from a safe distance to hit the enemy with chip damage, however mind the spread. You can also still get up close to make sure more of your pellets land. While the Saiga-12 may be weak, its firing speed is its biggest strength. It fires as fast as a Pistol, so it beats other Shotguns and rivals the AA-12 in speed. This makes this weapon good at ambushing opponents and winning intense fights. Trivia [ ] Being the weapon replacement of RJL Breach , it uses its firing sound. It also uses the same reload animation as the AK-47 .

Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Trivia 5 Audio (Outdated) 6 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] In-game, it functions similarly to the MS556 , although with the addition of a suppressor and a faster fire rate. The Sako 85 deals 60 damage, so it can 2-shot players to the body and will instantly kill an opponent upon a headshot. It also has a scope mounted on the weapon, which can be accessed using the RMB and the V key (scope button on Mobile). In conclusion, the Sako 85 has no major drawbacks other than its small magazine size and long reload time, however, these drawbacks are minor and should not be a major problem when it comes to using this weapon. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: One-shot kill to the head at all ranges. Suppressor reduces noise considerably. Fast firing rate for its class. Scope allows for better magnification. Perfect accuracy. Cons: Small magazine size of 6. Long reload time. Scope tracer may give away position Bolt-action Tips [ ] The Sako 85 deals a flat damage of 60, so it's both useful from long-range or defending yourself if an enemy attacks you at close-range. This means that it kills opponents with two bodyshots, or one headshot. 60 damage is enough for a teammate to get you an assist. Unlike most of the other Sniper Rifles which have a slow firing rate of 2.5 seconds, there's only a 1 second pause between shots with the Sako 85. This makes it more effective to fight opponents at close range, as you can quickly land two bodyshots to get the kill. If possible, avoid opponents who have more powerful weapons, such as Shotguns, Automatics or stronger Sniper Rifles. You may have a better chance against Pistols or Projectile weapons. Trivia [ ] The Sako 85 can fire calibers ranging from the .204 Ruger through to the .416 RM. The model this best represents is the 85 Classic Deluxe rifle. The bolting sound is taken from the weapon SSG-08 , from Counter Blox , another ROLVe game. The Sako 85 is the signature weapon of the Ghillie, Night Cap and Holiday Performer skins. The Sako 85 used to have a glitch that allowed players to fly around extremely quickly with it equipped. The Sako 85 is the 5th bolt-action sniper rifle to be added and the first sniper to have a suppressor. With the addition of the Sako, there are currently 7 suppressed weapons, with the other six being the MK18 , MP9-S , Mauser Carbine , Maxim-9 , Hush Puppy and the Vector . The Sako 85's muzzle flash does not appear at the end of the barrel and instead appears in front of the player. The Sako 85, when initially added to Arsenal , had a glitch that gave users the ability to fly (see Sako 85 Flying Incident ).

The Sawed-Off is a powerful shotgun for close and mid range combat. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. High magazine tube capacity. Low recoil. 1-by-1 reloading allows topping off. Cons: Slow rate of fire. Long empty reload time. Trivia [ ] According to Counter Strike wiki, the Sawed-off is based on the Remington M-870 with a shorter, 'sawed-off' barrel. The term \"Sawed-Off\" (also called Sawn-off in the UK and commonwealth countries) means shortening the barrel and the stock of a rifle and shotguns, making them easier to use at tight quarters. Sawed-off shotguns typically have a weapon length less than 18 inches and the shortened barrel will also give the gun a greater scatter effect if the user fires buckshot. Sawed-Off shotguns are infamously used by bank robbers because of their small size and ease of concealment. In Counter Strike: Global Offensive , while modeling a sawed-off, the name at the side of the shotgun was named \" Relphington 808 \" instead of \" Remington 870 \". This is due to the fact that Valve wants to avoid copyright issues.

SCAR-20 Current Alpha Overview Magazine Ammo 20 20 Damage 11-90 Gamemodes Standard Firing Mode Automatic Special Scope Kill Icon Contents 1 General Information 1.1 In-game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Trivia 4 Weapon History General Information [ ] The SCAR-20 is a weapon created by FN Herstal/FN America in Belgium and the USA. This weapon was removed in the Mega Update . In-game Information [ ] The SCAR-20 is a powerful sniper rifle, a 1SK upon a headshot, a minimum 3SK. high magazine size, low spread and recoil, and a fast rate of fire for a sniper. Because the SCAR-20 is automatic, players that hold the trigger will experience the full-auto firing mode. However, in the name of drawbacks, if the players run out of ammo, they will have to suffer with a long reload time. Another issue with the SCAR-20 is that they only have 40 rounds in total, meaning only 2 magazines are enough to waste all ammo. Luckily, due to the high damage and low spread, players will have a low chance of struggling with these issues. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Low spread and recoil. Fast rate of fire for a sniper. High magazine size. Scope allows for better magnification. Cons: Small ammo count. Long reload time. Slow fire rate for an automatic weapon. Trivia [ ] The SCAR-20 (Also known as MK-20 SSR , which stands for \" Sniper Support Rifle \") is a DMR ( Designated Marksman Rifle ) variant of the SCAR-17 , also known as SCAR-H (as seen in the current game) which it fires the same cartridge (7.62×51mm NATO) but there are some designs that are different compared to SCAR-H. It is pretty nice platform for SCAR-17 The pistol grip was shared from the M16A2 . The stock is different, as the buttplate and the cheek rest can be adjusted vertically or horizontally compared to SCAR-H's stock.

The duo was made by FN Herstal to satisfy US SOCOM requirements, and was chosen by them as their main rifle. Despite its adoption by SOCOM, however, only the SCAR-H was acquired and conversion kits made to swap the SCAR-H from 7.62mm to 5.56mm as needed. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The SCAR-H in-game is a very powerful weapon. It feeds from a 20-round magazine (previously 30), firing with an unexpectedly fast fire-rate, comparable to assault rifles such as the M4A1 . The weapon will, at least, 5-shot kill anywhere on the body, with a potential 2-shot kill to the head. The addition of a scope, which can be accessed with right mouse button (RMB), gives the players an advantage upon use at longer distances. Therefore, this weapon is best used at close quarters and mid-range without the scope and longer ranges with the scope. However, the SCAR-H has drawbacks, which is the high spread penalty upon hip-firing and low magazine capacity with only 20 bullets. Luckily, fighting at long range will not be a problem due to the scope. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High headshot damage. Fast rate of fire. Accessible scope allows for better magnification. Fast reload. Accurate when using scope. Cons: High spread upon hip-firing when not using scope. Moderately low long-range body damage. Magazine is easily expended due to its fire-rate. Below average magazine size for its class. Tips [ ] The SCAR-H is a powerful weapon, but a tricky one at that. Its spread and small magazine size will make it more difficult to get kills. However, using the SCAR-H's scope will make your shots more accurate. The scope is best at mid- or long-range. But at close-range, it's better to not scope in so you can easily track your target while shooting. The SCAR-H is notoriously infamous for running out of ammo at the worst time: most often in the middle of an intense fight. It has a fast reload, but it's not quick enough to reload while being fired at. Due to the SCAR-H's tricky nature, you must ensure that your chosen target will be easy to kill. Opponents in an open area or are at close-range are easy pickings. If an area has a lot of obstacles obstructing your view, do not aim for any opponents there. The SCAR-H will most often win against Pistols if not reloading, so try targetting opponents that are currently holding one. Gallery [ ] Current model preview, as seen in the Arsenal Discord . Trivia [ ] The current version of the SCAR in game appears to resemble a SCAR PDW, which is a carbine variant of the SCAR rifle family. This is evident by the collapsible stock on this weapon. This is also the case with the SCAR-L. Despite receiving a new model, the worldmodel shows the previous SCAR-H model. The Previous SCAR model is the SCAR-H, a 7.62x51mm NATO rifle. It appears to be the STD (Standard) model, judging by the barrel length. The SCAR-H appears to have a PM II scope attached to it, although the actual scope actually offers a 15x magnification. This was the signature weapon of Joe until it was replaced by the Nailgun in a later update. The previous SCAR-H is the M16A1 and M4A1's old firing sound but lower pitched.

Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The SCAR-L is a fully automatic weapon that deals average amount of damage against an enemy. The gun holds 30 rounds in the magazine and carries 90 rounds of ammo in reserve. It is best used in any ranges, since this weapon has low spread. It also has a fast fire-rate to pick off the opponent quickly. SCAR-L also had iron sights from the SCAR-H , which has been removed from the weapon itself due to having a usable scope. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast reload speed. Fast fire-rate. Low spread. High ammo capacity. High maximum damage. Cons: Low minimum damage. Tips [ ] The SCAR-L is one of the deadliest Automatic Rifles in the game. It shoots quickly, accurately, and deals a ton of damage in under a second. This weapon may have a low spread, but it's noticeably too wide at long-range. Get closer to enemies to secure a kill. The SCAR-L has distinct differences with its \"cousin\", the SCAR-H : The SCAR-L's magazine size is bigger by 10 bullets, so it allows more room for error. However , the SCAR-L does not have a scope, so its viable distance is only limited to at least mid-range. Gallery [ ] Current model preview, as seen in the Arsenal Discord . Trivia [ ] The model more resembles a SCAR PDW rather than a SCAR-L. This is especially prevalent when looking at the collapsible stock, as it is something that is only present in SCAR PDW models.

Scout Scrapped Current Alpha Pre-Alpha Overview Gamemodes Standard Firing Mode Bolt-Action Special Scope The Scharfschützengewehr 2008 (simply known as Light Sniper in Gun Game and shortly known as Steyr SSG 08 and known as the SSG 08 in Arsenal Archived ) is an Austrian bolt-action sniper rifle developed and manufactured by Steyr Mannlicher in 2008. This weapon was supposed to return in the Mega Update . However, it was scrapped as a tweet revealed. &#91; 1 &#93; Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Gallery 4 Trivia 5 Weapon History 6 Sources In-Game Information [ ] The Scout has similarities, compared to the M40 and MS556 with the damage and the fire-rate, making it somewhat a predecessor of the two weapons. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Good accuracy even without scoping. Scope allows for better magnification. Cons: Relatively slow fire rate. Gallery [ ] SSG 08 in real life. Trivia [ ] The Scout is superior to the SSG 04 in many ways, for example, the SSG 08 has an improved muzzle brake over the SSG 04, with the ability to attach a suppressor. The Scout is a highly accurate bolt-action sniper rifle, with a folding stock and an adjustable cheekpiece and butt plate. It usually is equipped with a bipod and a \"butt spike\" monopod for added stability, but however, It doesn't seem like it's in the in-game model. The Scout can shoot a .308 Winchester round, .243 Winchester, .300 Winchester Magnum and .338 Lapua Magnum in its detachable double-column box magazines. It can hold ten .243 Winchester or .308 Winchester, eight .300 Winchester Magnum and six .338 Lapua Magnum. However, the in-game model seems to hold the .243 Winchester or the .308 Winchester because 10 magazine capacity is the amount for which the Scout can hold. (If it is the .243 Winchester or .308 Winchester round) The Scout is taken from the popular game series that Arsenal based off, CS:GO (specifically The Arms Race Mode ). It is also in the game called Counter Blox , another game made by ROLVe . This game is heavily inspired by CS:GO .

The name in \"SG\" is an abbreviation for Sturmgewehr, which is \"Assault Rifle\" in German. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Gallery 4 Trivia 5 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] Added in the Winterfest Update , the SG550 is fully automatic that deals average amount of damage against an enemy. Like most assault rifles in the game, this weapon holds 30 rounds and stores 90 ammo in reverse. While it is best used in any ranges, it may cause a high spread if the player continued to fire the rifle. It also fires slow compared to the rest of automatic weapons. The SG550 had an accessible scope to cooperate with, by clicking the right mouse button. When used, it shoots almost as accurately than it is on the rifle. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Accessible scope by pressing the right mouse button. Moderate magazine size. Decent reload time. Cons: Slow firing rate. High spread upon hip firing. Gallery [ ] Scope. Weapon render. SG-550 in real life. Trivia [ ] The name of SG550 is mistakenly spelled as SSG-550 in Revenant3D's render on Twitter . The model in-game is possibly based on the SG 551 LB , due to its shorter handguard compared to the real SG 550. While not being apart of the model in-game, the render showcased by Revenant3D featured a foregrip. Like the G36 , the magazine has studs and can be locked with other magazines for faster reloading. Despite its improved variant, the SG 553, being in another ROLVe game Counter Blox , this gun never appears in the Counter Blox gamemode.

A reliable, simply designed, and relatively inexpensive weapon, the SKS was first produced in the Soviet Union (USSR) but was later widely exported and manufactured by various nations. In-game information [ ] The SKS can instantly kill an opponent with just one headshot and can 2-shot-kill enemies when shot to the body with a high magazine size and fine reserve. The fire rate is slow, making each shot count in combat. The tactical reload when shells are still in the muzzle is also slow, making timing important for the gun to not make the user die. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Decent empty reload time. Decent Firerate Cons: Slow pullout speed. Relatively slow tactical reload speed. Tips [ ] The SKS excels at mid- to long-range combat, but is better at close-range combat if it becomes more inaccurate. This weapon's spread isn't as similar as some of the other Marksman Rifles, so beware of this. The SKS has two types of reloads, both of which have advantages and disadvantages. The magazine reload (when the current magazine is empty) reloads the entire clip at once, but it takes a while to do so. This won't help if you're currently being attacked by an enemy. The individual bullet-reload (done if reloading while there's still ammo in the current clip) is good for reloading in an intense fight, and will give you a full ammo clip if done in time. Trivia [ ] The SKS has a broken inspect animation. The letters \"SKS\" stands for a Russian phrase called \"Samozaryadny Karabin Sistemy Simonova\", which translates into \"Self-loading Carbine of the Simonov System\". The animations seem to be from Unit: Classified for the SKS, which is another game that ROLVe created. It is one of the three weapons to have a mid-reload. The others are M1 Garand , and Springfield Rifle .

It shoots projectile balls affected by gravity. It has an infinite ammo capacity and therefore no reload. However, this does not mean the user should constantly hold down the trigger and fire forever because that can easily give away the user's position. To be effective with this weapon, the user has to predict where the enemy is going and shoot a little ahead of where they are going (due to travel time of projectiles) to hit their shots.

As its name implies, is snow curved up into a ball. It retains the same functionality of a projectile, such as an arch and the speed, and deals slightly more damage than a melee attack. Like other projectiles, timing is key. Contents 1 Pros &amp; Cons 2 Tips 3 Trivia 4 Audio 5 Weapon History Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast rate of fire. High ammo pool. No reloading required. Cons: No headshot multiplier. Low damage. Fires a projectile, meaning that timing is key. Projectile arches, making it difficult to hit players. Tips [ ] Snowballs can be thrown quickly, but they are also very weak, taking three to kill an opponent with full HP. It's better at getting assists rather than direct kills, so try sticking close to teammates if you have this weapon. This weapon is very bad against other weapons, but it especially loses to Shotguns or Automatics. Snowballs lack a damage range, so it deals a flat damage of 45 from any distance. It is recommended that you use this from mid-range to easily hit opponents and avoid easily getting shot at. Keep a look out for any opponents using a Sniper Rifle as they can easily counter this strategy. Trivia [ ] Just like the Water Balloon , the snowball could have been used to obtain the Fire Golem skin for the discontinued Cryptid Hunt . It is a signature weapon of the Ice Cream Man and Snowman skins. It has the same exact stats as the Water Balloon . Its a one-shot-kill weapon it the Snowball Fight gamemode .

The Soul Pistol , even with a close-range headshot, requires three shots to kill, making this weapon have measly damage. Its weakest damage is fall-off for 20 for bodyshots and 50 for headshots, Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast rate of fire. High magazine capacity of 17. Moderately fast reload. No recoil. High headshot and close-quarters combat (CQC) damage. Low spread. Cons: Low minimum damage. Tracer shots can give away the shooter's position. Fast ammo decrease on repeated shots. Tips [ ] The Soul Pistol's very tight spread makes it useful at mid-range. However, it best performs at close-range, where its damage is ramped-up enough to kill opponents in only two shots. Further from close-range takes 5 shots, but this will be easy since this weapon has 17 shots per magazine. As with every Pistol, this weapon is useless at long-range, as its spread becomes a lot more noticeable. The Soul Pistol does shoot tracer shots, but they are very hard to see compared to other weapons. Unless you're in a dark area, you don't have to worry about opponents finding your position.

It was generally sold to military and police forces, though many were sold on the civilian market as well. Its imposing appearance and its purpose as a military shotgun led to imports of the SPAS-12 to the U.S. being stopped by the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, despite it being renamed to the \"Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun\" (for which it most certainly was not designed). In-game Information [ ] It is the second fastest firing shotgun in the game. Holding down LMB will allow this weapon to be fired in a pseudo-full-auto state. Most players should be able to get a kill with this weapon. However, if you empty out the magazine, an extremely long 5.5 second reload time will have to be endured. This rarely happens though because it does massive damage per round despite not being a one-hit kill. Players should keep note of the spread as it increases when fired continuously. Most players will get a kill before having to go through an empty reload. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast rate of fire for a shotgun. 1-by-1 reloading allows topping off. High magazine size for a shotgun. Dominates in close range. Cons: High ammo consumption rate. Very slow 5.5-second empty reload time. Low damage per pellet. High pellet spread upon continuous shots. Tips [ ] The SPAS-12's bullet spread is actually more vertical instead of horizontal. This will make it easier to pick off individual opponents. It may look tempting, but it is recommended to not use this weapon while approaching an enemy from a distance, especially since you only deal 8 damage per pellet. Use your Knife to get closer to opponents and then switch back to the SPAS-12 once you're confident you can take them out in under 3 shots. If it's impossible to close the distance, space out your shots instead of spamming to deal respectable damage. A teammate that's nearer to your target can get you an assist. Trivia [ ] The SPAS-12 was once formerly known as the \" Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun \", although the US Assault Weapons Ban led to the renaming of it to the \" Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun \". It was first developed as a combat shotgun. When finishing the reload, the character animation appears to use the chamber to charge the weapon, unlike before, which appears to use the fore-grip to cock the weapon instead of using the chamber. The SPAS-12 can actually be changed from semi-automatic to pump-action, to allow it to reliably cycle low-pressure rounds such as beanbag shells and tear gas rounds. This is the signature weapon for Shock Force, Rioter, Punk Rioter and Breacher. This weapon is tied with the Barrett for the 4th longest reload time, with 5.5 seconds, only surpassed by the MG42 with a 5.75 second reload time, the Musket with a 6-seconds reload time, and the Dual Volcanics with an 18-second reload time. However, you can fire while reloading. The SPAS-12, XM1014 , and the Inertial Shotgun are the only semi-automatic shotguns in the game. In the Anniversary Update , the damage was buffed from 6 to 8. The SPAS-12 model and animations were previously taken from Typical Colors 2, where it is known as the \" Deathblow \", being a secondary weapon for the Trooper, Arsonist and Brute. Despite the SPAS-12 in Arsenal being semi-automatic, the Typical Colors 2 variant is pump action. The model also uses the Tokyo Marui company version of the Franchi SPAS 12 . The firing sound effect used for this weapon was taken from the Panic Attack in Team Fortress 2 . The model in-game has it's folding stock removed. The SPAS in game reloads a shell without using the carrier latch button Gallery [ ] SPAS 12 in real life.

When equipped, the user will hold the opened Spellbook in their left hand, while the right hand shows the current spell selected. The Spellbook has three spells: Fire , Ice , and Darkness . To switch between spells, press the reload button. All spells are projectiles (which are not affected by gravity), so timing and patience is key. The Fire spell deals 60 damage and will inflict 4 dmg per second of burn damage until the player dies or picks up a health pack, similar to the Flamethrower . The Ice spell is the weakest, only dealing 40 damage. However, any targets hit will have their movement speed slowed down for 5 seconds. The Darkness spell is the strongest, dealing 90 damage. Additionally, hitting targets will make their screen shake, although they can counter this by adjusting their aim. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] General Fire Ice Darkness Pros: Contains 3 usable modes for added versatility. Super fast projectile speed. Very minimal projectile arch. Has infinite ammo. Instantly kills any enemy that is on fire. Cons: Timing and careful aim is required due to the projectile. Sluggish fire rate. No headshot bonus on first hits. Pros: Burns enemies, doing a little bit of extra burn damage. 2-hit kill regardless of range and hit location. When an enemy is burned, they will take critical hits from weapons that also do fire damage. 1-hit kill when the burn is not treated in 5-7 seconds upon a hit. Cons: Burn damage is extremely minimal (Only 4 damage per second). Afterburn can easily be stopped if enemies pick up health pack. Pros: Slows down enemies, which can be extremely useful for taking out enemies who use the knife. Slowing down enemies allows you to more easily hit players. Cons: Does less damage, taking 3 hits to kill a player. Slowing enemies isn't a top priority, as the enemy can still shoot you. No headshot multiplier. Pros: Shakes the player’s screen, possibly causing them to lose their aim or focus. Kills a player in 2-hits regardless of range and hit location. Fastest projectile speed of all the 3 spells. Cons: More professional players won’t lose their aim while their screen is shaking. Very small niche, as there aren’t many situations where screen-shaking would be useful or lifesaving. Tips [ ] The Spellbook has multiple strategies for kills. However, all three spells have their risks, so it's important to decide which one to use. The Spellbook takes 1.5 seconds to switch between spells. It's a good idea to hide and pick your spell before you start fighting, as you'll easily be killed if you switch spells in an intense fight. It's important to practice with the Fire spell in particular, as it's the very first spell avaliable. This especially would help if you suddenly obtain the Spellbook while in an intense fight. The Spellbook is better at getting assists rather than direct kills due to its ways of dealing damage. Stick close to teammates to make this weapon more effective. The Fire and Darkness spells deal enough damage for a teammate to finish the job. The Fire spell is very deadly. Not only is its afterburn last long enough to kill a target, but landing a Fire spell on burning targets will insta-kill. Using the Ice spell on an enemy will make them too slow to run away, allowing you or your team to kill them easily. You can even take this a step further and backstab your slowed target with your Knife . Opponents hit with a Darkness spell will make their aim automatically shake for 5 seconds, making it harder for them to shoot accurately. This can be worked around if the player is more experienced as they can easily shift their aim to counteract the shaking. Beware of this. The Darkness spell's projectile speed is the fastest of the three spells, so it's easier to land from a distance. With the Spellbook in general, stay at mid-range to make it easier for your spells to hit your targets. Close-range is dangerous, and long-range will make it impossible to land any hits. Trivia [ ] This is the only weapon that has a lasting effect on the enemy. This weapon, the Tavor 's Incendiary shells, the Flamethrower , the Acid Spitter and the Flaming Pumpkin are the only weapons that have an afterburn effect. The Spellbook has the longest lasting afterburn. The Spellbook along with the M16A2 and Tavor are the only weapons in the game that can switch abilities. Erroneously, the control guide suggests that the Spellbook's modes can be switched with the right mouse button, which is not the case. Before being patched sometime in March, there was a bug with the Fire Spell that happened if a player died from burning, they would still be marked as your target even after respawning. Therefore, if they died to any environmental causes or died via resetting, it would count as your kill. The Spellbook is the signature weapon for the Mothree, Phantom Thief Magician, and Wizard skins.

Contents 1 In-game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Trivia 5 Gallery 6 Audio (Outdated) 7 Weapon History In-game Information [ ] The Spencer Carbine will always deal 87 damage to the body, and will instantly kill upon a headshot dealing 108 damage to the player, irrespective of range. It fires from a 6-round tubular magazine, with a unique animation played upon reloading; characters will open the butt plate of the Spencer, before removing and replacing the tubular magazine. It requires a brief period after every shot to re-cock, due to the rifle's lever-action mechanism. The Spencer Carbine can be compared to the Henry Rifle with it's same firerate, damage, magazine capacity, and the double jump ability, but they are contrasted due to its reload time and ammo pool. The Spencer Carbine also has the ability to double jump: players can double-tap space on the desktop version, Xbox players can double-tap \"A\", and Mobile players can tap the jump button twice. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Has no spread. Capable of double jump, allowing greater movement. Cons: Slow rate of fire. Has high recoil. Somewhat long reload time. Has low magazine capacity. Quick movement speed makes it harder to land shots. Tips [ ] Although the Spencer Carbine has the ability to double-jump, make sure you do not overuse it. Remember that this weapon only shoots one bullet, and extreme movements like double-jumping will make you miss more shots. Use the double-jump ability to instead find higher places to shoot from, and escape enemies while reloading. You can also double-jump towards enemies to deal ramped-up damage. The maximum is 117, which will guarantee a kill. The Spencer Carbine only has 6 shots in one magazine, along with a very slow reload. Make every single shot count, as you will easily be killed if you miss all of them. This weapon has no spread, so it is recommended that you try to land a shot from long-range. Trivia [ ] The Spencer fires a .52 caliber bullet and can fire at a rate of around 14-20 rounds per minute. The magazine on the Spencer is an unusual location, found in the stock of the weapon. The reload animation in Arsenal is not the proper way to reload it; in order to reload the Spencer, people will either remove the spring and plate and drop cartridges in, or utilize a \"Blakeslee Cartridge Box\", which enables faster loading of cartridges into the magazine. The design is similar to a Sharps Carbine that was used in the American Civil War. The double jump ability is most likely a reference to the Flanker from Typical Colors 2 , a former ROLVe game.

It would then go on service in 1906 and be replaced by the M1 Garand in 1936. In-game Information [ ] The Springfield Rifle is a heavy hitter. It boasts massive damage, being able to one-shot any enemy at close ranges without a headshot, only a two-shot kill at longer ranges. Its weakest possible damage is 85, which is more than enough for a teammate to get you an assist. However, the Springfield Rifle has a few drawbacks. It only has 5 shots before it needs to reload, and it has a slow firing rate of 1 second between shots. It also has very powerful recoil, which can throw off the user's aim. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Fast empty reload. 1-by-1 reloading allows topping off. Has no spread. Firerate can be increased by double keying Cons: Slow rate of fire. Small magazine size. Somewhat high recoil upon firing. Tips [ ] Because the Springfield Rifle is the only Marksman Rifle with noticeably high recoil, this weapon might be a bit more difficult to get a kill with. The main tip is don ' t panic. The Springfield Rifle is more effective if you shoot carefully rather than recklessly. Do not spam your shots. You only have 5 bullets per magazine, and the Springfield Rifle has a somewhat slow reload. Make sure your shots count. This weapon is most effective at close range, as its ramped-up damage maxes out at a whopping 243 damage. Try to sneak up behind oblivious enemies to make it easier to secure a kill. If you cannot get close to opponents, simply take aim and try to land a shot from a distance. If you're lucky, a teammate will get you an assist, promoting you to the next weapon. Gallery [ ] Reload 1 (Tactical) Reload 2 (empty) Springfield Rifle in real life with slings. Trivia [ ] The Springfield Rifle and the M1 Garand are the only weapons that have a faster empty reload time. The gun in-game can block the player's view if using stretched resolution or black bars. When reloading with the Springfield Rifle, the player will fill the whole magazine using a stripper clip if the rifle is completely empty instead of reloading one-by-one. It shares the same firing sound as the TOZ-106 , albeit louder While the Springfield Rifle was replaced by the M1 Garand in 1936, it was still used (and modified) by the Marines and the Army as a sniper rifle during WW2. The rifle remains popular as a civilian firearm, historical collector's piece, a competitive shooting rifle, and as a military drill rifle.

The Squeaky Hammer is a melee weapon which appears to be a toy hammer. It grants a speed boost and the ability to double jump. Upon hitting a player, it makes a higher-pitched bat hit sound effect. The Squeaky Hammer is the sole weapon of the clowns in the Clown Infection gamemode , where the clowns are given many abilities inaccessible to normal players. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Faster swing rate than other melee weapons. Double jump allows better mobility. Gives a major speed boost. Cons: 5 hits required unlike the 3 hits for normal melees. Trivia [ ] This is one of the only melee weapons to be exclusive to a gamemode, with the others being the Sword , Venomshank , Firebrand , Darkheart , Illumina , Ghostwalker , Windforce and Ice Dagger . This is the first melee weapon to be exclusive to a gamemode and be in-game as a knife skin as well. The second is the Classic Sword . Announcers will say their backstab lines when getting a kill with the Squeaky Hammer despite it being unable to demote players. The Squeaky Hammer deals the second least amount of damage for a melee, only dealing 23, with the usual Knife doing 36 damage for a front hit. The only melee that does less damage is the Fasticuffs , doing only 20 damage for a front hit.

Constructed from old wood and sheet metal, and held together by screws and leather belts, it boasts a handcrafted appearance. It comes with a bottle of holy water that is used to imbue the projectiles with power. The Stake Launcher can usually one-shot anywhere to the body if the players are at the minimum range. Hitting the secondary fire button will trigger an animation of pouring the contents of a holy water bottle into the hole on the user side of the receiver, upgrading the next projectile fired to deal splash damage and making the weapon emit sparkles. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Usually one-shot anywhere to the body at minimum range. Very high minimum damage of 90. Can pierce through multiple targets. Holy water adds splash damage. Cons: Slow rate of fire. Low magazine capacity of 9. Slightly long reload. Fairly high recoil. Gallery [ ] Pouring Holy Water. Workshop submission. Redesigned bottle without religious symbols. Original concept art. Cleaned up concept art. Trivia [ ] Strangely, the Stake Launcher is the only weapon that deals less damage upon a headshot than the maximum body damage. The Stake Launcher currently has a glitch where the splash damage can be detected without using the holy water special. The Stake Launcher's Holy Water bottle originally had a cross on it, however this was changed to avoid religious offense. The Stake Launcher is the signature weapon for Agetha skin .

It is a projectile weapon that deals 100 to 150 damage on hit. It's a ball that is thrown very fast and is affected by gravity. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros Has infinite ammunition Moderate throw rate Rebound ability One shot kill Firerate can be increased by double keying (instantly switching to melee and back Cons Easily dodgeable Hard to hit enemies with because of the projectile arch Only rebounds once before it no longer deals damage. Tips [ ] The Superball may be easy to dodge, but there's a couple of scenarios where you can easily secure a kill: Throwing at an opponent who's jumping. Throwing at an opponent currently recoil jumping (this weapon archs less if throwing more vertically). Standing on a higher platform and throwing at the opponents below you. From long-range, as long as you angle it correctly. The Superball does not bounce off players, so you can potentially get a multi-kill if you line up your shot perfectly. Remember that the Superball can only rebound once . After that, it will no longer deal damage, even if it touches an enemy. This is why it's important to aim higher than to the floor. \"Rolling\" the Superball on the floor also won't work.

The Dragunov was made to be a squad support weapon as according to the Soviet Union, the long-range engagement ability was lost to ordinary troops when submachine guns and assault rifles were adopted. It is still being produced and is widely used to this day. In-game Information [ ] The SVD in game functioned similarly to that of the Mosin-Nagant , because of the 60 damage on the body. It was very powerless in close, medium, and even long range, mostly due to the long time until hitting another shot. The best thing to do was to aim for the head. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: One-shot kill to the head. Moderate bodyshot damage. Scope allows for better magnification. Cons: Slow fire rate. Small magazine capacity. Trivia [ ] While the SVD looks similar and functions like the AK-47, it is not a variant of the said gun. The ammo it uses is 7.62×54mmR which is the same caliber that the Mosin-Nagant uses. The weapon doesn't have its own icon. Instead, it uses the placeholder icon. The rate of fire is inaccurately slow. However, in reality, the rate of fire can be varied. The SVD scope is also called PSO-1M2 .

It also appears as one of the random weapons obtained in Swordfights. It is a reference to various classic Sword fighting games. The Sword does 52 damage on hit, allowing it to kill an enemy in two hits. However, it does not have the ability to backstab. With its high damage, getting a kill with the Sword can be made fast. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Has the ability to demote player on kills. Cons: Unable to backstab. Mediocre swing rate. Trivia [ ] Unlike the classic sword from the classic ROBLOX games (the weapon it is based on), it cannot lunge, a special attack that allowed users to reach higher places by being airborne or do higher damage. This is the signature weapon of the Annihilator, Crusader, King, Northern Crusader, Queen and Shard skins. This was released as a case -only melee in the Anniversary Update known as the Classic Sword. This was solved as false as the melee finally appeared in the shop on 02/14/20. This is the second weapon to have both skin and weapon variants, the first being the Squeaky Hammer . In private server Brickbattle, the sword does not function as it used to. On 12/08/18, the Sword was given to ROLVe staff members, wherewolfAMV and Campyfire to test it. It had different variants for both of them. It had a slightly visible gray texture with a black handle for wherewolfAMV. It had a long katana like a blade with a brown handle for Campyfire. The Linked Sword in Typical Colors 2 is also used by the Bloxxer Noobs in Vs. Bosses .

The Tavor TS12 is designed and produced by Israel Weapon Industries (IWI). In-game Information [ ] The Tavor's high damage from each pellet allows easy sniping at longer ranges, along with its fast rate of fire. It can be used for close quarters and mid-long range effortlessly. When right-clicking, the Tavor can also switch between different modes through rotating the magazine tubes, that contain different types of shells. The shells include 12 Gauge, Slug, and Incendiary. Slug will instantly kill an opponent from any range if the shot lands. However, it does have a slower fire-rate. It also has a tighter spread. Incendiary has the special effect of burning enemies. This will slowly chip away at their health until they die or find a health pack. However, the spread widens much more each time the Tavor is fired compared to the other modes. It can also deal headshot damage on burning targets whether or not the player was shot on the torso. In general, the 12 Gauge mode is enough to effortlessly dispatch of enemies, however, for very far away players, switching to Slug might be the best option. However, mode switching does take quite a bit of time, and it is recommended that you stay in 12 Gauge while in combat, or else you'll be left vulnerable for a second or two while you switch modes. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] General 12 Gauge Slug Incendiary Pros: Very fast rate of fire. 1-by-1 reloading allows topping off. Has different bullet modes to switch. High overall damage per pellet. Cons: Low magazine capacity of 5. 1-by-1 empty reloads are slow. Mode switching somewhat takes a long time to cycle. Pros: High damage. Cons: Somewhat wide pellet spread. Pros: Instantly kills at all ranges. Tight spread. Has no spread penalty. Cons: Fires slower than the standard Gauge. Pros: Burns enemies, doing extra damage. Deals headshot damage to burning targets whether or not the player was shot on the head. Cons: Very high spread when spamming. Afterburn can easily be stopped if enemies pick up health pack. Burn only does 4 damage. Tips [ ] The Tavor may have three types of ammo, but realistically it is best to focus on the 12 Gauge shells. If you suddenly get promoted to this weapon while in the middle of a fight, you won't have time to switch ammo. Switching between ammo types takes about 2.5 seconds, which will not help you if you're currently being shot at. Only do this when you first spawn or while alone. Each of the Tavor's ammo types specialize in different situations: 12 Gauge acts a regular Shotgun, shooting quickly in a fixed bullet spread. It's good for intense fights at close-range. Slug makes the Tavor act similar to a Sniper Rifle, as it insta-kills with only shooting one bullet down the crosshair. Best used at long-range. Incendiary is especially deadly, but has wide spread. Best used at close-range when there's multiple opponents so the afterburn effect credits you with an assist when they're killed. The Tavor is a very deadly weapon in gamemodes such as Randomizer and Gun Rotation due to their lack of promotion-on-kill mechanic, which will allow you to go on rampages and kill opponents both near and far thanks to its various types of ammo. Gallery [ ] Inspect. Stage one of development. Stage two. Mode switching. Tavor in real life. Trivia [ ] The Tavor was revealed in the Arsenal Discord on May 12th, 2020. The Tavor design is based off the IWI TS-12 shotgun. This weapon with incendiary rounds, the Spellbook , the Flamethrower , the Acid Spitter and the Flaming Pumpkin are the only weapons who have the afterburn effect. The Tavor shotgun is the second weapon with projectile changing, the first being the Spellbook. The Tavor slug round does the fourth highest damage in the game. However, this only applies in point-blank ranges. The Tavor was removed from randomizer for an unknown reason. The Tavor, the Spellbook , and the M16A2 are the only weapons in the game that has the mode switch ability.

They were developed by Intratec, an American subsidiary of the Swedish firearms manufacturer Interdynamic AB . Introduced in 1984, the TEC-9 was made of inexpensive molded polymers and a mixture of stamped and milled steel parts. The simple design of the gun made it easy to repair and modify. The TEC-9 developed a negative reputation for its association with organized crime, street gangs, and mass shootings in the 1990s. Most notably it was used during the 101 California Street shooting and the Columbine High School massacre. However, it was a commercial success, with over 250,000+ being sold, regardless on who or where it was sold to. Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The TEC-9 , like the G-18 , is an absolute shredder. Its extremely fast fire-rate rivals that of an assault rifle. It also has ramp-up and can instantly kill at close quarters. However, it comes with a high spread penalty. Burst-firing the TEC-9 can assist with firing at longer ranges, as the spread penalty rapidly decreases with time after the last shot has been fired. The TEC-9 is one of the few weapons to have a low first-shot accuracy, meaning it has a low chance to fire in a straight line, similar to the MK18 . Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast fire-rate. Instant kill at close quarters. Quick reload. Large magazine size for a pistol. Cons: High spread penalty. Low minimum body damage. Magazine is easily expended due to its fast fire-rate. Low first-shot accuracy. Tips [ ] The TEC-9 is a very deadly weapon, just like its real life counterpart. It shoots at automatic speed, deals really good damage, and has a whopping 20 bullets per magazine. The main weakness of the TEC-9 is range, thanks to its spread . It will dominate close-ranged fights, but is a crippling weakness at further distances. The TEC-9's reload is pretty fast, allowing you to reload while getting shot at during an intense fight. Gallery [ ] TEC-9 in real life. Trivia [ ] The TEC-9 is not naturally fully automatic and is manufactured as a semi-automatic pistol out of the factory. However, the ease of modification allowed criminals to convert the weapon to fully-automatic, causing the US to force Intratec into creating a closed-bolt version of the TEC-9 that was harder to convert without special parts. The TEC-9 does have a second variant dubbed the TEC-9 Mini , a variant removing the pistol's shrouded barrel. The TEC-9 was taken from Counter Blox along with many other weapons. CB:RO's version of the TEC-9 was semi-auto unlike the TEC-9 in Arsenal . The TEC-9 is one of the automatic pistols along with the G-18 , the Electric Revolver , the Little Tom , and the Falkor . People often mistaken the TEC-9 as a SMG, despite looking like one alongside with the Falkor . The TEC-9 used to have an appearance in the game Typical Colors 2 . It is the signature weapon of the Nevaeh skin .

The intentions for this weapon is represented as a soccer ball, as the main goal for players to catch and score it to the opposite team's ring before it could explode on the hands of a grabber. It shares the same model as the BrickBattle Bomb , however it is attentively fused. In-Game Information [ ] Because of its fusion, the Bomb behaves like a regular time-bomb and would go off when the user holds it for 8 seconds, sending them to the Penalty Box and resets the match. However, this can be prevented when passing to a teammate or a opponent, as the exploding timer is set back to 0 seconds simultaneously. Similar to OddBall , the Bomb uses a marked indicator. Pros and Cons [ ] Note: The pros and cons here only documented the gameplay of Bombfest gamemode. Pros: Infinite ammo. Exploding timer is reset if passing to a teammate/enemy. Can be thrown with RMB. Cons: One player gets it per game. Activates explosion if holding it for too long. Players can accidentally pass it to the enemy if not careful.

In-game Information [ ] In almost every aspect except the fire rate, this is comparable to the MG42 . Its move-speed while carrying it is faster, the reload does not take as long, and it deals less damage. However, its low damage can be a problem for players. Dealing only 11 damage along with the high spread can be a massive issue at almost all ranges, especially long ranges, where it is almost unusable. This can be avoided if players aim for the head, killing an enemy in four hits instead of ten. In order for players to not suffer both downsides, players should tap fire to make every shot count. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage at close range. Fast fire rate. Quick reload time. High magazine capacity of 50. No recoil. Cons: Low minimum damage. Slower movement speed compared to other SMGs. High spread. Trivia [ ] The Tommy Gun is the Mobster, Hitman, and Kingpin's signature weapon. The Tommy Gun has many different nicknames, including the \"Chicago Typewriter.\" The Tommy Gun fires 45 ACP in real life. This Tommy Gun is fitted with a drum magazine. Drum magazines were rarely used for Tommy Guns by the U.S. as it was bulkier than a box magazine. Despite this, The Tommy Gun is most commonly seen with a drum magazine in other parts of media. The Tommy Gun had no reload sound except for the hammer recock. The Tommy Gun's reload animation is incorrect. People would have to pull the bolt back before pulling out the drum, and the character doesn't take out or insert the drum right. You would have to push it out of the side in real life, not just pulling it downwards. The previous firing sound was taken from Red Orchestra 2: Rising Storm .

In-game Information [ ] An unusual firearm, owing to its use of a bolt-action mechanism, the TOZ-106 is a cheap and heavy weapon. While its bolt-action mechanism may at first appear to be a detriment, the weapon's bolt speed is similar to the pump speed of other shotguns. As with most shotguns, the TOZ-106 will instantaneously kill an enemy upon a close-range shot, although the TOZ-106 is capable of long-range kills, should the user aim for the head. As with most other manually operated weapons, players will have to cycle the bolt before they can fire again, placing more of an emphasis on hitting their target. The TOZ-106 also comes with a low magazine size of 4, the second-lowest size in its category. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High headshot damage. Fast reload for a shotgun. Reloads all shells when reloading. Firerate can be increased by double keying Cons: Slow rate of fire. Has low magazine capacity. Slow movement speed. Very low body damage. Tips [ ] The TOZ-106 is not very good at intense fights, as it both fires and reloads slowly. It's better off if you used this weapon for sneak attacks instead of approaching opponents head-on. This weapon's low body damage makes it less viable at mid-range. This is why getting close and quickly getting a kill is important. Make every shot count. If you miss, do not panic and keep a steady aim. Try not to reload while you still have ammo, as one good shot is all you need to get a kill. Better to risk it than to play it safe with the slow reload. Gallery [ ] The TOZ-106 in real life with a 2-round magazine. Trivia [ ] The TOZ-106 is a cheap and small bolt-action shotgun colloquially known as the Death of the Chairman . It's a compacted version of the MTs 20-01 and is generally used as a hunting weapon within the Russian Federation. The model was made by Discord user and Mad STUDIO developer, nettimato who also created the STEN , the Calico , the G11 , the Dual Shotguns , the Focus and the Stake Launcher . The TOZ-106 is the 4th magazine fed shotgun to be added to Arsenal . The TOZ-106 uses 20-gauge rounds in real life and can feed from 2 or 4-round box magazines.

Since then, more than one million of these firearms have been made, and that number still continues to count up today. The TOZ-34 is a double-barreled shotgun that was released in the archived phase of Arsenal during mid-2016. In-game Information [ ] The TOZ-34 is a powerful shotgun from medium and close quarter combat. but not in long ranged combat, as each pellet deals 12 damage, about 3 times the single pellet damage of the XM1014 and Lever Shotgun . Like the DBS and DB Shotgun , the TOZ has a low 2 shell capacity due to the 2 barrels, and doesn't automatically reload even when it's empty just like all the guns in Arsenal Archived . It has a low ammo pool, even lower than the DBS. Pros and Cons [ ] Pros: Decent damage. Fast reload if there's still 1-round in remain (tactical reload). Cons: Low magazine &amp; ammo pool. Low minimum damage. Somewhat slow empty reload. Trivia [ ] The model is based on a soviet double-barreled shotgun of the same name made in 1964 by Tulsky Oruzheiny Zavod . It can fire either 12, 20, 28, or 32 gauge in real life.

Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio (Outdated) 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The TP Launcher shoots toilet paper rolls within high damage. It also lacks in fire rate, however it's an automatic-projectile weapon. An interesting fact is that the TP Launcher has a 1-by-1 reload, making it one of the only projectile weapons to have this, along with the Rocket Launcher . Having a projectile arch is another disadvantage for making it difficult to hit enemies at further ranges. It should also be noted that this weapon performs best from long distances. Unlike the other weapons in this game, it deals more damage from far away (at a max of 118) and is weaker at close distances (at least 80). Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Instantly kills from long range. 1-by-1 reload allows topping off. Decent magazine capacity of 20. Shot ammo has trails that the user can use to adjust aim if they miss. Cons: Long empty reload time. Slow fire rate. Has projectile arch, making it harder to hit enemies. No headshot multiplier. Shot ammo can be traced back to the user, exposing their location. Tips [ ] The TP Launcher's method of damage is reversed: unlike the other weapons, it deals more damage when far away from opponents. This makes you a deadly force at long-range. It will be easy for you to hit opponents, but they can't shoot back at you just as easily. You can practically hit an opponent on the other side of a map if you angle your aim just right. The TP Launcher is the only Special weapon that can go toe-to-toe with Sniper Rifles. The TP Launcher's biggest con is its slow fire rate, which is a 0.8 second delay between shots. This makes you more easy to kill at close-range, especially since the TP Launcher is weaker at this distance. Due to this con, the TP Launcher naturally loses to Shotguns, Automatic RIfles, and SMGs, which can quickly kill you at close-range. Make your shots count. This weapon may have 20 toilet paper rolls at once, but its reload speed is incredibly slow which can leave you vulnerable to opponents. Do not use all your ammo at once, and reload constantly. Gallery [ ] Stage one development. Stage two. Stage three. Trivia [ ] TP Launcher was revealed in the Arsenal Discord on October 17th, 2020. The TP Launcher is one of the joke weapons along with the Literal Gun , the Pocket Potassium , the Potassium Power , the Origami Gun , the Very Long Bat , and the Dispenser . The TP Launcher is mostly a joke reference from the current pandemic which so many people fighting over TPs. It also might reference \" toilet papering \" (TP-ing), a prank where you throw toilet papers on trees and buildings. TP-ing happens more often during Halloween. The TP Launcher is one of the only projectile weapons that allows 1-by-1 reloading. The reloading sound cycles through different pitches.

It is a shiny metallic garbage can, filled with reflective green liquid representing trash. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Large hitbox means that you don't need to precisely aim at the target. High damage. Fast fire-rate. Relatively high ammo capacity. One \"Shot\" kills at any distance. Ability to fly. Cons: Projectile arches, making targets at longer ranges harder to hit. Trivia [ ] The thrown projectile has collision. This means it is possible to fling yourself and even perform a rocket-jump like mechanic by throwing it toward the ground whilst walking forward. Additionally, it may sometimes kill players who touch it even if it hasn't been recently thrown. It is the signature weapon of Lenny, Garbage Handler and Trash Worker skins .

In-game Information [ ] A single shell fired from the Trench Gun will always deal 24 damage on the body and 34 to the head, no matter the distance. If all pellets strike a target, they will deal with a combined damage of 216 to 306, instantly killing anyone close enough. As with the majority of shotguns, the Trench Gun fires in a circular pattern. It has an above-average reload time for its class. The Trench Gun is similar in statistics to the Inertial Shotgun . They have high pellet damage and the magazine capacity being at 5 shells at max. However, the Inertial Shotgun fires faster, has less pellet spread, has a slower reload time and deals slightly less damage. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage per pellet is useful at farther ranges. 1-by-1 reloading allows topping off. Rather tight pellet spread. Firerate can be increased by double keying Cons: Small magazine size. Long empty reload time. Slow rate of fire. Tips [ ] The Trench Gun is one of the easiest (if not the easiest) Shotgun-class weapons to get a kill with, due to its even bullet spread and immense damage. This weapon can even be used from mid-range and (if you're lucky) long-range, and it will still deal respectable damage. If shooting further than close-range, remember that aiming for the head will give you an edge in fights. The Trench Gun's reload is moderately quick, so it will help you fight off enemies currently locked in an intense fight with you. In gamemodes such as Randomizer or Gun Rotation, you'll stay alive longer with this weapon fully reloaded. Trivia [ ] The Trench Gun in-game appears to be a hybrid of the M1897 Trench Gun and the Winchester Model 1912, with the barrel modelled after the former and the receiver and stock for the latter. While the weapon in-game lacks this ability, the Trench Gun has the ability to slam-fire, meaning that one can rapid fire the weapon as if it was a semi-automatic shotgun. In real life, this can be done by holding down the shotgun's trigger and rapidly pumping the foregrip back and forth. The Trench Gun model is used for another one of ROLVE's games, Typical Colors 2. It is used by the Trooper , Arsonist , Brute and the Mechanic and is called the Bullet-Stormer in said game. The Trench Gun along with the Rocket Launcher , the Peacemaker , the Barrett , the G-17 , the AUG , the XR15 , and the DB Shotgun are the only primary weapons that appear in the Arcade gamemode. The Trench Gun may be a reference to the Chrome Shotgun from one of Valve's games Left 4 Dead 2 , which bears a \"chrome\" finish and an attached flashlight.

It is an alternate and somewhat powerful counterpart of the Superball , as it bounces longer, travels faster through the air, and has multiple rebounds. However, this is balanced by its lower damage and even slower firing rate, although firerate can be increased by double keying (quickly switching to the melee and back). Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Has infinite ammunition. Fast projectile speed. High damage. Bounces aggressively, useful in enclosed spaces. Firerate can be increased by double keying. Cannot be easily dodged due to its size. Cons: Hard to hit enemies because of the projectile arch. No headshot multiplier. Slow throw rate. Tips [ ] The Ultraball is incredibly powerful against groups of opponents. It bounces around a lot , which can take out an entire squad with just one ball. Beware that it does not insta-kill, unlike the Superball . If there's no teammates present, opponents will need two Ultraballs to be killed. Alternatively, you can throw an Ultraball at a specific angle where it hits an opponent, bounces off a wall, then hits them again for the kill. Because it doesn't insta-kill, it will bounce off of opponents' bodies. Take this into account if throwing at specific angles. If you throw a single Ultraball into a room, you can (almost) guarantee it will kill every opponent inside. Good areas to try this strategy are: Any of the three doorways on Beach . All indoor areas of Villa . Both buildings on Tuscan . The tunnel with the overhead aquarium tank on Aquatic . The loghouse featured in Lodgeworks . The hallway with teleporters on the first floor of ROLVe Station . The main building featured in Ridge Park . Trivia [ ] The Ultraball was not mentioned in either of the update log posts for the Summer Update III . It uses the same inspect animation as the Superball . Due to its size, it can block 1/2 of the screen.

Heckler &amp; Koch developed the UMP as a lighter and cheaper successor to the MP5 , though both remain in production. The UMP has been adopted by various agencies such as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Other than agencies, they also served in various military forces. A small number of UMPs chambered in .45 ACP were officially purchased by the 5th Special Forces Group of the United States Army Special Forces, with some of the weapons seeing limited service in the early years of the Iraqi insurgency, making them among the small number of submachine guns deployed by the U.S. military in recent conflicts. In-game Information [ ] With a slower than average fire rate and a low magazine size, the UMP-45 may not seem suited to being called an SMG. However, the weapon is versatile, able to two-shot kill at close range. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage at closer ranges. Fast reload time. Fairly low spread. Cons: Slow fire rate for its class. Low minimum body damage. Lower magazine compared to other SMGs. Tips [ ] The UMP-45 is one of the more familiar SMGs, as it deals very good damage and has a spread pattern that's easy to get used to. Unforuntately, the UMP-45's spread is not low enough to be used from a distance. It becomes impossible to land shots from beyond mid-range. The most effective strategy would be to start firing from mid-range and then get closer to your target, getting you a headstart on the fight and securing the kill. This strategy will still work if you die in the middle of it, as you'll have dealt enough damage for a teammate to get you an assist. Make your shots count, as this weapon has a slow firing rate for an SMG. A few missed bullets could allow your opponent to kill you first. Trivia [ ] The UMP-45, or Universale Maschinenpistole 45 (German for \" Universal Submachine Gun \"), was developed by H&amp;K as the successor to the MP5; although, both the UMP and MP5 still remain in production and use to this day. The UMP can come with three different calibers; the .45 ACP, the one in-game, 9x19mm, and .40 S&amp;W. Some models of the UMP have 2-round burst as an option. The UMP-45 firing sound is same as the old UMP-45 in CS:GO . Gallery [ ] UMP-45 in real life with the grip.

The low spread makes it easier to land headshots. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Low spread. Large magazine size. High maximum damage. Fast reload. Cons: Low minimum body damage. Moderately slow rate of fire for its class. Tips [ ] The USP is practically the M9 but with better accuracy, so treat it as so. The spread is still noticeable at a distance, but being more accurate, the USP's effective distance is not restricted to close-range. Because of its hefty damage and fast reload, the USP is very good at intense fights. Gallery [ ] USP in real life. Trivia [ ] This weapon was originally suppressed in the Arsenal Archived . When this weapon was added back, it reused the M9 's sounds before being changed at a later time. The 12-round mag suggests that it fires .45 ACP rounds.

The lack of spread and recoil was an easier way of hitting headshots, but this really was not a real advantage, because of the gun under-performing at longer ranges. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Virtually no spread and recoil. Silenced shots won't give away your spot for enemies. Cons: Somewhat slow rate of fire. Trivia [ ] The USP-S is inspired by the weapon with the same name in CS:GO. This is one of many weapons in old Arsenal that was taken from CB:RO Archived . This is most likely reason for this move by ROLVe was because they had the meshes already. This is a secondary weapon for the Counter Terrorist class in CB:RO . USP-S is a silenced version of the USP . The USP-S is modeled after the USP Tactical, (because of its ability to equip suppressors). While the USP is modeled after the standard variant with the same name.

Because of its use of a telescoping bolt (a technology borrowed from the ZK 476), the weapon was smaller than other SMGs from its time. The magazine/grip is nearer towards the center of the weapon, making the Uzi a more ergonomic design and allowing for more intuitive reloads. In-game Information [ ] The weapon has an emphasis on close-range power. In-game, players can expect a quick fire rate coming from the UZI, able to dispense from its 30-round magazine within several seconds. However, as it is an SMG, the Uzi deals with a relatively low amount of damage; players will deal 16 damage at the most extreme ranges to the body, and deal 36 damage upon a close-range headshot. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Quick reload. Good maximum damage. Low spread. Good firerate. Cons: Low minimum damage. Ineffective at longer ranges. Tips [ ] The Uzi is noticeably weaker than the other SMGs in the game. This means that there's less room to make mistakes when aiming. The headshot damage range is barely more powerful than its normal damage range, too. So either headshots or bodyshots will still give you the same amount of progress. Go for opponents at close-range instead of mid-range to ramp-up your damage as much as possible. To make up for its abysmal damage, the Uzi reloads moderately fast, which will allow you to reload in the middle of intense fights. Trivia [ ] The Uzi Submachine Gun is an open-bolt, blowback SMG manufactured by IMI ( Israel Military Industries ), and is a part of the Uzi family, which includes weapons such as the Mini Uzi, Micro Uzi , and the Uzi Pro. The Uzi was one of the earliest weapons to utilize a telescoping bolt design, allowing its magazine to be loaded into the pistol grip and lower the overall length of the weapon. Uniquely, the Uzi only has 1 moving part, which is its bolt. A smaller, dual-wielded version of the UZI was added in the Halloween Update , the Micro Uzis. The Uzi Submachine Gun was sold more to the military, law enforcement, and security markets than any other SMGs made. The weapon fires 600 rounds per minute in real life, but its cousins, the Micro-Uzi and Mini-Uzi can fire up to 1250 RPM. It is the signature weapon of Isaiah and Doctor skin .

They use an unconventional delayed blowback system combined with in-line design to reduce perceived recoil and muzzle climb. In-game Information [ ] The Vector in-game is fit with a suppressor and a futuristic sight, which can be accessed by right clicking or pressing \"LT\" on Xbox. Its low spread helps with fighting opponents at longer ranges, as well as a fast fire-rate, which helps damage opponents quickly. However, the Vector has downsides, such as somewhat low damage, long reload, and a magazine that expends easily. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Swift fire-rate. Accessible sight. Low spread. Decent damage at close quarters. Moderate magazine size. Cons: Low minimum damage. Somewhat long reload. Magazine size is easily expended due to its fast fire rate. Gallery [ ] ADS Stage one development. Stage two. Stage three. Stage four. Stage five. Stage six. Stage seven. Vector in ROBLOX Studio . Vector in real life without magazine. Trivia [ ] Vector was revealed in the Arsenal Discord on July 23th, 2020. It is also the first weapon to be streamed while in development. This is one of the seven weapons to be suppressed, the others being the Hush Puppy , the MK18 , the MP9-S , Mauser Carbine , the Maxim-9 and Sako 85 . The Vector in-game is based on the CRB model because of the barrel shroud. The barrel shroud acts as a suppressor in-game. This weapon is one of the weapons that has the ability to use ADS, the others being the MK18 , the M14 EBR , the DBS , the Falkor , the Pulse Musket and the DB Chauchat . The Vector is the only SMG with ADS. The firing sound for the Vector is more or less the Hush Puppy's firing sound, but pitched down a little. The 30-round mag suggests that it fires .45 ACP rounds. Looking carefully, the ammo actually reloads before the actual reload animation is finished, this can be used as an advantage. The reloading sound is the same as the UMP-45 , but in a different order.

Alike other projectiles, the water balloon feeds from a large ammo pool and does not reload. In-game Information [ ] In-game, it functions and behaves very similarly to the Snowball . Throwing it at opponents deals an amount of damage that is slightly higher than a melee attack. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast rate of fire. High ammo pool. No reloading required. Deals the same amount of damage from any distance. Cons: No headshot multiplier. Weak damage. Fires a projectile, meaning that timing is key. Projectile arches, making it harder to hit players. Tips [ ] Water Balloons can be thrown quickly, but it's also very weak, taking three to kill an opponent with full HP. It's better at getting assists rather than direct kills, so try sticking close to teammates if you have this weapon. This weapon is very bad against other weapons, but it especially loses to Shotguns or Automatics. Water Balloons lack a damage range, so it deals a flat damage of 45 from any distance. It is recommended that you use this from mid-range to easily hit opponents and avoid easily getting shot at. Keep a look out for any opponents using a Sniper Rifle as they can easily counter this strategy. Trivia [ ] This weapon has a rare chance of appearing in game. This weapon was used to obtain the Fire Golem skin alongside Snowball . The firing sound of this weapon is the same as the Snowball.

          "raw": "range: The minimum to maximum amount of damage a weapon can do. Headshot damage is written inside brackets ( ). Ramp-up: Maximum damage against opponents close to you. Fall-off: Minimum damage against opponents far away. Firing rate: How fast a weapon can shoot its ammo. Reload speed: How fast a weapon can reload. Spread: How far from middle of the crosshair will a weapon shoot. Bloom: How wide the crosshair gets when firing a weapon. Magazine capacity: How many bullets (or ammo) that can be fired before a reload. For example: 6 / 24. The user has six bullets to shoot before reloading. Reserve ammo: How much ammo players have that can be reloaded. If the reserve ammo runs out, knife is automatically deployed. For example: 30 / 100 . The user has one hundred reserved ammo. Scope: A weapon's ability to see players and objects far away upon right-clicking. The view turns black except for a big circle in the middle. ADS (aim down sights): Like Scope, but the user can only see anything at mid-range. The view turns to sights of the weapon. Hip-Firing: Attempting to shoot without using Scope or ADS, most effective against nearby targets. Distance [ ] Close-range: Being very close to opponents, within 20 studs. Mid-range: A sizeable distance two players, about 50 studs. This distance is naturally met when approaching or running from an enemy. Long-range: Far away from opponents, 100 studs or more, especially if both players are on opposite ends of a map. Miscellaneous [ ] Intense fight: When two or more players are actively shooting at each other. Double-keying: Switching to a melee and back to the main weapon. Most often used if the main weapon is a projectile with a slow firing speed. To double-key on PC, press 3 → 1 or Q twice as fast as possible. One-and-done: A weapon is powerful but its reload is incredibly slow, pushing users to get a kill within the first magazine. Special Abilities : A weapon that has a unique way of dealing damage. Examples include Fan-fire, Rebound, Afterburn, etc. Trivia [ ] The Admin Launcher , Influencer Launcher , Creagle , Golden Creagle , Very Long Bat and the Fasticuffs are the only weapons exclusive to ROLVe staff. The Literal Gun does the highest damage of all weapons in the game with 810-1350 (1035-1552) damage, followed by the musket with 600 (690) damage. The Golden Musket, all snipers (except for the muskets and the DBS), both the Hush Puppy versions, Handcannon, Luger, Crossbow, Python, Webley, Pathbringer, Peacemaker, Deagle, Makarov, Armament, SCAR-H, Dragunov, Springfield Rifle, SKS, DB Chauchat and Autobow deal triple damage for headshots. Some weapons have a set kill effect regardless of the one you have equipped, such as the Railgun . The Railgun , Laser Rifle , Handcannon and the R800 all use the Evaporate kill effect. The Rocket Launcher , RPG , Plasma Launcher and the M16A2 grenade launcher all use the Gib kill effect. The Spellbook 's fire spell and Firebrand use the Scorch kill effect. There are weapons and weapon badges that were supposed to be in the game but were cut-off upon release. Weapons Battle Axe - The Battle Axe was originally supposed to be in the Swordfights game mode (VIP Exclusive) but never made it into the game. The reason for the Battle Axe being removed is, as of now, unknown. Mop - The Mop was supposed to be in the Brickbattle gamemode, but didn't make it into the game upon the update's release for unknown reasons. It was supposed to be able to fling opponents off the map. It was later added as a normal melee in the Minor Monday Update . Scout - The Scout was originally supposed to return in the Mega Update , but was scrapped as a tweet revealed. The Lever Shotgun , original DB Shotgun , Rocket Launcher , original Flamethrower , Minigun , Mosin-Nagant , Pump Shotgun , SPAS 12 , M40 , Windicator , Hi-Power , Battle Axe , Bat, Fisticuffs, Brass Knuckles, Machete, Icicle, Pan and Butterfly Knife were taken from Typical Colors 2 . The scrapped Battle Axe and the original Railgun model was taken from the ROBLOX catalog. Some weapons feature the Reflectance on weapon parts such as Trench Gun , DBS , Pulse Laser , Laser Rifle , Nailgun , DB Chauchat , Windforce and Butterfly Knife . Because of this, these weapons on maps that took place on nighttime are completely black.

Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The Webley does a lot more damage per shot and has less spread, however, it has a slower rate of fire. It instantly kills on a headshot and takes two hits to kill on the body. It also has damage fall-off, which can lead to an instant kill at close ranges. However, players should take note of the slow rate of fire and 6-round speedloader, which can be easily expended despite the fire rate if the player cannot hit their shots, as well as the slow reload time. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Very low spread. Has very minimal recoil. One-shot-kill on the head. Firerate can be increased by double keying Cons: Slightly small magazine size. Slow rate of fire (somehow). Slow reload time. Tips [ ] The Webley's ability to insta-kill opponents at close-range makes it a very deadly weapon in intense fights. Beware of the Webley's slow firing rate, as it can punish you for missing your shots during intense fights at close-range. Flicking your aim before shooting with this weapon can often get a kill. Try it! From mid-range, it takes at least 2 landed shots to get a kill, so you'll have to aim more carefully from this distance. The recoil is more noticeable at this distance, so it might be harder to get headshots from there. To balance out its ability to dominate intense fights, the Webley reloads very slowly. More often than not, your opponents will have an easy time killing you when you're reloading the Webley. The Webley is practically considered a \"one-and-done\" weapon due to its power and slow reload, so you must get a kill within the first magazine. Gallery [ ] Webley in real life. Trivia [ ] The Webley had six different variants such as the Mk I, Mk II, Mk III, Mk IV, Mk V , and Mk VI . The Webley service revolvers were some the most powerful break-action revolvers ever produced. Despite the ability to fire on double-action in real life, the in-game firing mode is single-action The Webley's reload animation is based on the same gun with the same name, featured in some Battlefield games. It is the signature weapon of the Trash Worker skin . The Webley's firing sound has the same sound as the Peacemaker , but it was in high pitch.

Contents 1 In-Game Information 2 Pros &amp; Cons 3 Tips 4 Gallery 5 Trivia 6 Audio 7 Weapon History In-Game Information [ ] The Windicator has it's damage fall-off that has a one-shot capability upon a headshot at any range, and on the body at closer ranges. The fairly fast rate of fire helps with killing enemies quickly. The reload time is very quick with the use of a speed loader to load the weapon. However, the Windicator's drawbacks are the small 6-round capacity, despite the fast reload making up for the small magazine size, but the high spread as well. Combined with the somewhat fast rate of fire, spamming the Windicator results in the spread being very wide which forces players to get kills up-close. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: High damage. Fast rate of fire for a revolver. Quick one second reload. One shot on the head. One shot if very close to the target. Cons: Moderate spread upon continuous shots. Tips [ ] The Windicator is good at mid-range, but is most effective at close-range. At mid-range, it takes about 2-4 shots. At very close distances, one shot is an instant kill. If your opponent has a Shotgun or Automatic weapon, stay at mid-range to avoid getting easily killed. Do not use the Windicator at longer ranges because of its spread. The very first shot when it's fully loaded will be 100% accurate, so you can shoot at an enemy far away and hope that a teammate gets you an assist. The Windicator's very quick reload will help you while in intense fights. Back away from the enemy currently firing at you when reloading to make it harder to get killed. Once those shots get loaded in, jump towards them to ramp-up your damage. If you're coming to Arsenal as a Typical Colors 2 player, the Windicator is a slightly more buffed stock Revolver used by the Agent. The Windicator's damage is stronger, as its maximum ramped-up damage is 110, compared to the Revolver which only does a max of 60. The Windicator also crits on headshot, just like TC2's Ambassador. If one of your shots do 64 damage or more, you can quickly finish your target off with your Knife to demote them, just like an Agent would. Gallery [ ] In third person. Windicator in real life. Trivia [ ] The Windicator model and sounds in Arsenal are taken from the stock Revolver in Typical Colors 2 , used by the Agent class, albeit with a lack of rear sights. It's also the Agent's in-game signature weapon in Arsenal, as well as Private Eye. The Windicator, as of the Halloween Update , has the most balance changes made to it. This type of revolver is a snub-nosed revolver, with any size of frame with a short barrel. The old firing sound was taken from Team Fortress 2's Revolver .

In-game information [ ] A single pellet from the XM1014 will do 6 damage at long ranges, and if all pellets hit at close range, you will deal 110 damage. Its semi-automatic nature allows you to easily dispatch enemies close with a barrage of shells. Unlike its similar rival, the SPAS-12 , the XM1014 fires slower, but has a faster reload time. However, the weapon is loaded by hand and takes around 4 seconds to reload fully, a half-second for each shell, and a second taken to chamber the shotgun. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Above-average rate of fire for a shotgun. 1-by-1 reloading allows topping off. High maximum damage per pellet. Decent magazine size for a shotgun. Cons: Long empty reload time. Wide pellet spread upon continuous shots. Tips [ ] The XM1014 is most effective during approximately the first 5 shots. The remaining shots will be a bit difficult to deal with. Reloading just one shell in after 5 shots will reset the bullet spread, and finish off enemies during intense fights. Unlike most of the other Shotgun-class weapons, the XM1014's effective range is slightly closer to enemies while at mid-range. It is recommended you get a little closer to enemies before you start firing shots. Trivia [ ] The XM1014, as is its USMC prototype designation, is manufactured by Benelli Armi SpA as the Benelli M4 Super 90 . The XM1014 uses a simple ARGO (auto regulating gas operated) system, allowing it to be cheaper and less complex than other semi-automatic shotguns. The XM1014 was also in Typical Colors 2 where it is originally known as the \" Specialist \" and is a primary weapon for Flanker. The XM1014 also appears in Counter Blox and is taken from the respective game. The XM1014 can reliably function up to firing 25,000 rounds without replacement of any major parts. Despite the XM1014 being depicted as fully-automatic, in real life the Benelli M4 family shotguns are semi-automatic.

XR-5 FG-1508 Advanced Battle Rifle ) is an airsoft weapon now made to fire lethal cartridges. With the interior of an M4 carbine and a sleek, ergonomic, polymer body, the XR15 provides a more futuristic take on its predecessor. In-game Information [ ] The XR15 is notable for being one of the only weapons to fire a two-round burst with every pull of the trigger. It fires from a 20-round magazine, with 60 rounds in reserve. The weapon's burst speed is quite fast, though players will need to fire at least two bursts to kill an opponent. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Fast rate of fire while bursting. Low spread. Decent damage for its class. Fast reload speed. Cons: Small magazine size. Gallery [ ] Weapon render. XR15 in real life Trivia [ ] XR15 was revealed in the Arsenal Discord on September 8th, 2019. The XR15 is an identical copy of the CSI S.T.A.R XR-5 FG-1508 Advanced Battle Rifle , an airsoft rifle built around a M4 gearbox. It also bares resemblance to the CZ 805 BREN created by Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod in 2009. The XR15 is the third burst-operated weapon that was added to Arsenal . This, the M16A2 , the Plasma Launcher , and the DB Chauchat 's ADS are the only burst-operated weapons in Arsenal . While the M16A2 and Plasma Launcher are 3-burst, the XR15 and DB Chauchat are 2-burst weapons. The XR15's sounds are the same as the M16A2 , albeit slowed down and lowered in pitch. This along with the Rocket Launcher , the Peacemaker , the Barrett , the G-17 , the AUG , the Trench Gun and the DB Shotgun are the only primary weapons that appear in the Arcade gamemode. In real-life, the XR-15 can fire 2 separate ammo types, which are the .223 Remington and the 5.56x45mm NATO.

The Z80's piercing shot is one of the most unique features, meaning as long as another target is behind an enemy and the shots land on the front, both enemies will get hurt. The fast rate of fire and high damage means that shredding enemies won't be difficult. However, the most unique feature of the Z80, overheating, means that if players fire the Z80 too long, they will have to suffer from three seconds of not firing. The high spread penalty as well causes an issue at further ranges, although going closer fixes the issue. The Z80 used to be a futuristic semi-auto laser pistol instead of an SMG. It used to have a magazine of 10 and reserve ammo of 30 and did 24-120 damage on the body, 26 on the head and did 120-136 damage with a full charge. It also didn't have the overheating due to the magazine system. The model of Z80 was also a fictional variant of the Vladas Model 92. Pros &amp; Cons [ ] Pros: Very fast fire rate. Has infinite magazine and ammo. High damage. Piercing ability allows to hit more enemies Cons: High spread penalty upon continuous firing. Tracer shot can give away the user's position. 3 second cooldown after firing consecutively. Tips [ ] The Z80 has infinite ammo, but its overheat feature prevents you from using it too agressively. (This is indicated by the little screen on the top of the Z80 that slowly fills up with a red color.) As a real number, you only have 15 shots per \"magazine\" before it forces itself into cooldown. To prevent overheating, you must space out your shots. It also makes your shots more accurate as its spread will not get high quickly. At long-range, only your very first shot will guarantee to hit (just like every weapon). However, it is especially important for the Z80 as a headshot from this range is worth 99 damage. If you land a headshot from that far, you can depend on a teammate to go in for the kill, crediting you with an assist. Because the Z80 pierces through enemies, keep an eye out for groups of enemies clumped up together. However , shots that pierce through opponents have limited range. It will only hit other opponents directly behind your first target. (In other words, its piercing shots are not like the Railgun .) You also don't necessarily need to get kills. Just one shot deals enough damage so that a teammate can kill them in one or two shots which will credit you with an assist.

Originally, the Z80's light-emitting parts change color to correspond with the player's team. Before the buff given time the weapon a few hours upon release, the Z80 forced players to hit every single shot in the magazine in order to body shot kill an enemy. The original Z80 has a unique draw animation, in which player characters will inspect the pistol momentarily. The original model of Z80 seems to be modeled after Vladas Model 92 , a Lithuanian prototype submachine gun, which was easily produced and manufactured since it had a cheap and cost-effective design. However, the creator declined its necessary amount of creations. This is the signature weapon of the Alien, Alien In Disguise &amp; the Space Soldider skins. The previous model was used for Mechanic's secondary weapon, the Noisy Cricket in Typical Colors 2 . Unlike other weapons, the original Z80's charge method is not shown on the right-hand lower corner of the screen. This, along with the Pathbringer , the BH10 , and the Pulse Musket do not use the Evaporate kill effect by default. The Z80 has the same inspection animation as the Tavor . There is a way to bypass the overheating by quickly switching to the knife and then switching back.
